nexusDescription="[b][b][size=3][u]Description :[/u][/size][/b]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />This mod adds chain mail to Dawnguard heavy armors, heavy gauntlets, heavy boots and full helmet so it is more \"Heavy\" than just a tag in the armor section while there isn't any different aspect between light and heavy gauntlets/boots in vanilla. \n<br />\n<br />It also add the option to add chain mail to the\xa0Steel Plate armor set in replacement of the vanilla armor instead of the blue cloth under the armor or you can add it as a standalone armor to keep the two Steel Plate version.\n<br />All armors have been retextured for both male and female version.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The mod is available in english, french, german, italian and spanish and is customizable according to your needs : If you only want the Steel Pate Armor replacement or just the\xa0\x44\x61wnguard modifications, you can choose in the install menu of the mod during installation.\n<br />\n<br />.esp are flagged as .esl so it doesn't count in your load order.\n<br />\n<br />Please [b]report any bug[/b] while in the game or during installation of the mod.

Don't use both \"[i]Nordplate - SA[/i]\" textures and \"[i]Nordplate - Vanilla[/i]\" textures with the standalone version or there will be no differences between the two armor version ! Use \"[i]Dawnguard[/i]\" textures with the \"[i]Chainmail Dawnguard.esp[/i]\" for chainmail dawnguard.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][size=3]Compatibilities with :\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b][/u]-\xa0\x46rankly HD Dawnguard Armor and Weapons with the compatibility patch in the optional files.\n<br />-\xa0Improved closefaced helmets.\n<br />- USSEP\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][size=3]Incompatibilities :\n<br />[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />- Any mod that changes Dawnguard Armors or Steel Plate armor.
