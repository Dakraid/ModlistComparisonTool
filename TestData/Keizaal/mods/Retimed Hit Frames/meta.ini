nexusDescription="[color=#ff0000][b][color=#ffffff]For clarity: You do not actually need to download this mod to use it. Use [url=https://github.com/ShikyoKira/Project-New-Reign---Nemesis-Main]Nemesis[/url] instead. Click on the checkbox for \"Retimed Hit Frame\" and launch the behavior engine to apply the mod.\n<br />\n<br />Since tktk1 has expressed interest in implementing his own version of this mod, I no longer feel the need to continue development.[/color][/b][/color][url=https://imgur.com/a/2dCINc0]\n<br />\n<br />Here's a short clip that shows what this mod does.[/url]\n<br />\n<br />This mod does not change animations. All it does is change the moment at which the attack connects.\n<br />\n<br />The mod currently covers both one handed and two handed weapon users.\n<br />It does not alter the timing for first person attacks yet.\n<br />\n<br />Are there any other attacks that should be retimed? Let me know with a comment.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\n<br />This is a simple asset replacement mod. Install with a mod organizer. Alternatively, don't download this mod. Instead,  use the \"Retimed Hit Frame\" patch in Nemesis.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility:[/b]\n<br />If you're not using Nemesis, this mod will conflict with any mod that also replaces 1hm_behavior.hkx. For compatibility with other mods that modify the same file, don't download this mod. Use the patch in Nemesis."
