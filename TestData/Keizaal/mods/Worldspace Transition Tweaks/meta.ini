nexusDescription="[color=#6fa8dc][size=5][b]Introduction[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[s]\n<br />[/s][b][color=#ea9999][size=4]While I no longer consider this mod to be a [i]beta[/i], I would highly advise you to careful read through any documentation regarding SSELodgen and DynDOLOD. If you're having issues with LODs, please go to the [url=https://stepmodifications.org/forum/forum/223-dyndolod-xlodgen/]official support forums[/url], as my own knowledge to the inner workings of SSELodgen and DynDOLOD is rather limited. Thank you.[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />In my goal to make modded Skyrim a more consistent world, I decided to undertake a project to make transitions between worldspaces, be it Vanilla, or modded, more smooth.\n<br />\n<br />Bethesda usually does this through a scripted event (talking to a NPC and being teleported to the worldspace, like from taking the boat from Skyrim to Solstheim) or bottlenecking the player by objects (for instance, Dayspring Canyon, using mountains to bottleneck the player through small auto-load door, which leads into the canyon).\n<br />\n<br />I wanted to take a different approach and actually make the player transition from one worldspace to another without the need of a small awkardly placed auto-loaddoor.\n<br />\n<br />So, I made this framework of triggerboxes that can be used for this purpose, which I dubbed \"pseudo-loaddoors\".\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e06666][b]Patches for this mod can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49316]here[/url][/b].[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=5][b]Pseudo-loaddoors: what are they?[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Pseudo-loaddoors are triggerboxes, which execute a script, upon the player entering, that does the following:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Calculate the players current coordinations on the map\n<br />[*]Convert these coordinates to the corresponding ones on the bordering worldspace\n<br />[*]Move the player to that point. (This will include a small loading screen.)\n<br />[*]Move any nearby NPCs (followers, enemies, and even dragons in the vicinity) to the other worldspace as well.\n<br />[*]Move any relevant objects as well.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />These pseudo-loaddoors can be viewed as a modder's resource and everyone is allowed to use them in their mods.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=5][b]Module: Skyrim/Solstheim[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This module includes making Skyrim/Solstheim visible and accessible from both sides.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a2c4c9][b]Making Solstheim/Skyrim visible from each side[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Landscape and objects from both worldspaces have been copied into each other. This makes it possible to generate LODs through SSELodgen (Terrain and Occlusion) and DynDOLOD (Trees and Objects), as such it makes both worldspaces visible from each side.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a2c4c9][b]Making Solstheim/Skyrim physically accesible from each side[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />I placed the \"pseudo-loaddoors\" at the borders of Skyrim/Solstheim. Unfortunately for this to work, I had to seal of certain areas that lead to the unused Morrowind area in both worldspaces. This will however be accesible in the same way, when Beyond Skyrim: Morrowind is released.\n<br />\n<br />By making these edits, players will be able to swim from Skyrim to Solstheim and back.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=5][b]Requirements[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE64[/url]: For worldspace transition scripts.\n<br />[*] [s][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6642]SSELodgen[/url]: To generate Terrain LOD and Occlusion culling.[/s] -&gt; This is an outdated version.

It only contains some lodsettings, which need to be in a BSA to be loaded properly. If they're loose files, the game will not recognise them. This will lead into the far off LOD of Solitude to be off, when you're in the Solstheim worldspace.\n<br />[/b][/color]\n<br />Please refer to their respective manuals and guides for additional information.\n<br />\n<br />Some more detailed steps:\n<br />\n<br />1. Have WTT loaded with \"WTT - Skyrim-Solstheim - Worldsetting.esp\" (or its variant if you use the paper world map) at the very end of your load\n<br /> order. Also make sure you have all required files for DynDOLOD installed.\n<br />\n<br />2. Use SSELodgen to generate Terrain LOD only.\n<br />\n<br />3. Install those files from SSELodgen as a new mod.\n<br />\n<br />4. Run Texgen.\n<br />\n<br />5. Install Texgen files as a new mod.\n<br />\n<br />6. Run DynDOLOD.\n<br />\n<br />7. Install DynDOLOD files as a new mod. With the \"DynDOLOD.esm\" loaded after \"Worldspace Transition Tweaks - Skyrim To Solstheim.esp\" and \n<br />DynDOLOD.esp loaded after \"WTT - Skyrim-Solstheim - Worldsetting.esp\" (be sure to active those ESPs as well).\n<br />\n<br />8. Run SSELodgen, but this time only generate occlusion.\n<br />\n<br />9. Install the file that SSELodgen has made (Occlusion.esp) and load it after \"DynDOLOD.esp\".\n<br />\n<br />10. Done. \n<br />\n<br />Note: (2021-11-18) I have been informed it is possible to only use xlodgen and get some pretty good results as well. I haven't done so myself though.

Be sure to read through this part, as it can make or break the mod![/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Do NOT rely on LOOT's default settings when you use this mod, as you might need to make custom rules for it:\n<br />\n<br />1. \"Worldspace Transition Tweaks - Skyrim To Solstheim.esp\" -&gt; Load just after the Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp, if you're using that one. Otherwise, load after all the official game's DLCs (Update.esm, Dawnguard.esm, HearthFires.esm and Dragonborn.esm)\n<br />\n<br />2. \"WTT - Skyrim-Solstheim - Worldsettings.esp\" -&gt; Load this one as low as possible, after most other ESPs. The only ESPs it needs to be loaded before, are: Paper World Map.esp, DynDOLOD.esp and Occlusion.esp (last one is used by SSELodgen for occlusion culling)\n<br />\n<br />3. Patches: Load these after their respective mods. Exception: \"WTT - Skyrim-Solstheim + Paper Worldmap - Worldsettings.esp\" (this can be found on the patches modpage) needs to be loaded after Paper World Map.esp, but before DynDOLOD.esp and Occlusion.esp.\n<br />\n<br />Example load order:\n<br />\n<br />Skyrim.esm (base)\n<br />Update.esm (base)\n<br />Dawnguard.esm (base)\n<br />HearthFires.esm (base)\n<br />Dragonborn.esm (base)\n<br />&lt;Creation Club ESLs&gt; (optional)\n<br />&lt;Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp&gt; (optional)\n<br />Worldspace Transition Tweaks - Skyrim To Solstheim.esp (NON-optional)\n<br />...\n<br />&lt;other mods ESMs or ESMified ESPs&gt; (optional)\n<br />...\n<br />DynDOLOD.esm (NON-optional)\n<br />...\n<br />&lt;all other mods ESPs&gt; (optional)\n<br />...\n<br />WTT - Skyrim-Solstheim - Worldsettings.esp (NON-optional)\n<br />&lt;Paper World Map.esp&gt; (optional)\n<br />&lt;WTT - Skyrim-Solstheim + Paper Worldmap - Worldsettings.esp&gt; (optional, only if you use paper world map)\n<br />DynDOLOD.esp (NON-optional)\n<br />Occlusion.esp (NON-optional)\n<br />[color=#e06666]\n<br />[b]In addition: Do not clean WTT - Skyrim-Solstheim - Worldsettings.esp and WTT - Skyrim-Solstheim + Paper Worldmap - Worldsettings.esp. LOOT might report ITMs, but those are intentional.[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=5][b]Extra information/tidbits[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />While followers and horses should move over properly from one worldspace to another, I had cases in which they didn't and weird glitches occured. (animation glithes, them getting stuck underwater, etc) If you do attempt to do this, make sure you save prior to this, in case this happens. In most cases, it should work fine, but for the times it doesn't, this extra pre-caution won't hurt. \n<br />\n<br />If you want to do even more safe, I would recommend using follower frameworks \"summon followers\" features (like [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7003]EFF[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18076]NFF[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37464]iAFT[/url], etc) for getting followers across. And similar features for horses and other mounts.\n<br />\n<br />Also, an extra tip: If a follower doesn't follow you when swimming, try swimming underwater and see if the follower catches up. This helped in my case.\n<br />\n<br />For horses, in order to get them to move over, I have to make the player dismount the horse first. As such, if that happens, be aware it is intentional. \n<br />\n<br />In order to make up for the height difference of both worldspaces, I added a lot of rocks on the bottom, essentially creating a trench. I decided to have some fun and put some small easter eggs to collect on the sea bottom. Nothing too great though. So if you're really curious go for it, but don't expect anything too big.\n<br />\n<br />That being said, some of the rocks might still have gaps/bad collision, so be aware of that. If you see an issue, please give me the FormID so I can look it up easier.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=5][b]FAQ[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Q: Does it still have a loading screen when travelling between Skyrim/Solstheim? Why?\n<br />A: Yes, it does, albeit a short one. I can't actually make Solstheim accessible in the Skyrim worldspace, due to an engine limit of 128x128 cells. If you go beyond that point, interacting with things like activation, dialogue, hitting with weapons and spells - will no longer work if you are outside the safe zone and facing away from the world origin. \n<br />\n<br />Q: Solstheim looks a bit too close to Skyrim.\n<br />A: I had a similar impression when I first looked at it. However, looking at lore maps, the distance seems to correct. It's probably because we aren't used to see Solstheim from Skyrim and as such, assume it's further away. That and the fact, Skyrim is scaled down quite a bit.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will this be available on consoles?\n<br />A: I myself won't port it, as I do not own a console and as such I would be unable to test/troubleshoot it. However, I do give permission for anyone else to do so. Unfortunately, due the SKSE, SSELodgen and DynDOLOD requirements, it's unlikely to happen though.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you make a version that doesn't have any of the requirements (SKSE, SSELodgen/DynDOLOD)?\n<br />A: I have no current plans to do so.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you do the same for other worldspaces?\n<br />A: Perhaps. I'm not sure yet. If I do, the next ones will probably be Japhet's Folly (vanilla worldspace) and Wyrmstooth (modded worldspace).\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you make a patch for sailing mod/flying mod X?\n<br />A: Perhaps. Some of them might work without a patch, while others will break it.\n<br />\n<br />Q: How about TCL (toggling collision, using console commands)?\n<br />A: I tested this multiple times, but was unable to get a consistent working result. Sometimes it worked without issues, other times not so much. I wouldn't recommend it. If you do test it like this, I will be unable to provide any support.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Can you make this an ESL?\n<br />A: Unfortunately, the amount of records far exceeds the limit of that of an ESL, for that reason, the ESP in this mod is impossible to make into one. However, the ESP is flagged as an ESM.\n<br />\n<br />Q: The plume in Solstheim is at the wrong locations/there are holes in the sea/mountains/land/rocks/etc. What can I do?\n<br />A: Make sure you properly regenerate LODs using SSELodgen and DynDOLOD, following the instructions and the available information. If you cannot see Skyrim from Solstheim properly and still see the Vanilla low res LODs in Solstheim's worldspace, you did something wrong. If the plume is in the wrong location, you either loaded this from a saved game (which you shouldn't do, but you can use the resetreference console command on to try to reset it) or your LODs are wrong. If your LODs are wrong, I would strongly suggest reading ALL the available information on it, including on this mods page. I've tried recreating the issue, but I cannot find the cause. It works without issues for me. If you cannot find a solution, please visit the [url=https://stepmodifications.org/forum/forum/101-dyndolod-xlodgen-support/]DynDOLOD/SSELodgen support forums[/url], as I cannot help you with this. Any questions asked, that are similar to this, will be fowarded to this answer.\n<br />For reference, you should be able to see mainland Skyrim from Solstheim, like [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48889?tab=images#lg=3&amp;slide=0]this[/url].\n<br />If it still has the low res Vanilla LODs, without any objects, I will refer to it as the \"Vanilla Mainland LOD\" bug.\n<br />\n<br />Q: I'm using incompatible mod X (Shadow of Morrowind for instance) and it doesn't work.\n<br />A: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide any support for that, for reasons I have listed above.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=5][b]Details for mod authors[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />If you are a mod author that wants to make their Skyrim/Solstheim mod visible from either side, here are some details to help you do so:\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />Cell [u]50,35 of Tamriel[/u] corresponds with cell [u]0,0 of DLC2SolstheimWorld[/u], based on the Gridmap by KlimeMaps from the Beyond Skyrim Discord and Atrayonis and Tamriel Rebuilt for the gridmap concept.\n<br />\n<br />The default water height of Tamriel is -14000 and DLCSolstheimWorld's is 256.\n<br />\n<br />Going by this information we can conclude the following.\n<br />\n<br />The amount of units/cells when moving objects from Tamriel to DLC2SolstheimWorld is:\n<br />\n<br />X: -50 cells = -50 * 4096 units = -204800 units\n<br />Y: -35 cells = -35 * 4096 units = -143360 units\n<br />Z: +14256 units\n<br />\n<br />The amount of units/cells when moving objects from DLC2SolstheimWorld to Tamriel is:\n<br />\n<br />X: +50 cells = +50 * 4096 units = +204800 units\n<br />Y: +35 cells = +35 * 4096 units = +143360 units\n<br />Z: -14256 units\n<br />\n<br />There are 2 xEdit scripts which will make the process of moving objects easier.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]Worldspace move references into another worldspace.pas[/b] -&gt; this one can used to move references (placed objects, etc) from one worldspace to another.
