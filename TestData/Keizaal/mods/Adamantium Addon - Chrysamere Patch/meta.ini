nexusDescription="Beyond Skyrim Bruma's BSAssets contains a really fancy Adamantium Ingot model, and I wanted to put it to use so people can appreciate it, so I set about cobbling together this set of adamantium gear. This was a spur of the moment mod and I don't really have any updates or plans for it moving forwards, so am unlikely to offer any other patches myself and this mod is offered on an as is basis.\n<br />\n<br />Adamantium Armor and Weapons are considerably harder to gather enough material to make and temper, and as a tradeoff have had their innate enchantment power increase carried over from Morrowind. Any enchantment placed on Adamantium gear will be 25% stronger (like Stalhrim, but for ANY enchantment). The armor set itself has armor ratings around that of Steel Plate, to balance it against the its magical properties.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Patches:\n<br />[/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Wyrmstooth[/b] - Adds multiple ore veins to select places on the island, this makes Wyrmstooth the best place to get Adamantium Ore to make/improve your gear.\n<br />[*][b]Chrysamere [/b]- Retextures Chrysamere to suit the adamantium aesthetic and makes it use Adamantium keywords and effects (Adamantium weapons have similar properties to silver weapons)\n<br />[*][b]Adamant [/b]- Patches the matched set bonus including in Adamantium Addon to match Adamant's version.\n<br />[*][b]PrivateEye's Adamantium Helm of Tohan [/b]- updated keywords and forwarded the retexture from the base mod's helmet.\n<br />[*][b]Legacy of the Dragonborn[/b] - updated keywords on the Helm of Tohan and Chrysamere. Forwarded the retexture from the base mod's helmet. (Note that this is a small consistency thing and is not a patch that is officially endorsed by the LOTD team)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=3][b]Credits:\n<br />[/b][/size]\n<br />PrivateEye for the Adamantium Helm of Tohan meshes and base textures used for the Adamantium Helm\n<br />NordWarUA for the meshes used to make the Armor, Boots and Gauntlets.\n<br />Beyond Skyrim for the Adamantium Ingot that inspired this set, as well as the unobtainable shield mesh that is used for this set's shield."
