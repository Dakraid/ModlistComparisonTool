nexusDescription="[center][b][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=6]3D Whiterun Trellis[/size][/font]\n<br />[size=3][font=Tahoma][i]\"2D or not 2D? Not 2D!\"[/i][/font][/size][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />This is a small mod that replaces the meshes and textures for the Whiterun trellis objects. The flat tellis have been converted into real 3D geometry.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Features[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]New optimized, 3D meshes for all Whiterun trellis objects\n<br />[*]Custom 2K diffuse for an improved iron look\n<br />[*]Optional wood texture available\n<br />[*]Custom environment maps for proper\xa0lighting\n<br />[*]Custom 2K normal map generated from a\xa0\x64\x65tailed, 1.5M poly version of the mesh\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b][size=6]Compatibility and Performance[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/b]\n<br />3D Whiterun Trellis\xa0meshes redirects the trellis part of the mesh to custom textures within a custom path. This means texture replacers will work, but not on the trellis, themselves. They will remain iron unless\xa0the custom textures are replaced, or the meshes are edited to redirect the textures to a new path.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Edits from USSEP and SMIM are included, therefore, conflicts with these two mods should be overwritten.\n<br />[*]3D Whiterun Trellis meshes should overwrite all other mods.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=3]Mod Authors[/size][/b]\n<br />Permissions are open for you to create and upload compatibility patches for your texture mods, as long as you credit this mod/author. The recommended and easier method is to simply replace our textures with your patch. Be aware the new trellis have custom UV designed specifically for them and their texture. However, authors may also include altered meshes within their patches, if required. Again, give credit where it's due and notify us, if you upload a patch.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Performance[/size][/b]\n<br />It should go without saying the new meshes add geometry; thus, increase the poly count of these objects. The circle around the tree is approximately 177K polys, up from just a few thousand in vanilla. This could have a small performance impact for users on lower-end systems. However, users with the recommended hardware for the game shouldn't notice much, if any, difference.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://www.mememaker.net/api/bucket?path=static/img/memes/full/2019/Aug/29/0/geometry-128636.png[/img]\xfeff[/center]"
