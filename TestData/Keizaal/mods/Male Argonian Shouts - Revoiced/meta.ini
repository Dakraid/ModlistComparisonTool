nexusDescription="[center]Ever been annoyed that Argonians use the default human voice for shouts, instead of having their more distinct, gruff-sounding voice?\n<br />Well, I decided to see if I could remedy that.\n<br />\n<br />Every shout, including the ones from the DLCs, have been re-dubbed by me, doing my best to get close to the vanilla male Argonian voice.\n<br />\n<br />V2 is out with louder/more aggressive shouts, if that's your preference. A demonstration of those can be heard here:\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]Z95Udgzz-ho[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />A demonstration of every shout in V1 can be heard here:\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]zA2dPltYVkM[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />To install, I recommend Mod Organizer, otherwise you can install manually by unzipping the \"sound\" folder and placing it in steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim Special Edition/Data[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/106226]Legacy Version[/url]"
