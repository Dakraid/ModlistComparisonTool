nexusDescription="The Adventurer's Backpack CC added new backpacks to the game for the player to craft or buy from vendors. I've made a couple of adjustments to the items to further enhance your backpacking experience.\n<br />\n<br />- Removed the enchantment shader from the inventory models.\n<br />\n<br />- Adjusted the crafting recipes to better reflect the designs of each backpack. All packs require leather, leather strips, and a corundum ingot to craft. Dark Leather and Thief packs require a stick of charcoal, Fine Leather and Mage's packs require a ruby, and Fur and Hunter packs require a cow hide.\n<br />\n<br />- Changed the price of all backpacks to be more sensible in respect to the materials it takes to craft them."
