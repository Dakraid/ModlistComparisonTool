nexusDescription="[center][color=#6fa8dc][size=3][b]\xfeffWhy Pocket Mammoths?[/b][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />I have always really liked Pocket Mammoths, from the first time I set eyes on them in ESO's Wrothgar zone and have had one as my pet in that game ever since. Recently I learned everything I needed to be able to create the best pocket mammoth implementation I would likely be able to in Skyrim and decided to give it a go.\n<br />[b]\n<br />[/b][center][color=#6fa8dc][size=3][b]Requirements[/b][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33746]Dynamic Animation Replacer[/url]\xfeff - Allows less intrusive swapping of animation files to remove the ground shaking and point to new edited sounds without affecting standard mammoths.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[center][color=#6fa8dc][size=3][b]What does this mod do?[/b][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Adds a new passive creature with its own custom skeleton to mountainous areas of Skyrim, mostly in The Reach and the frozen wastes oif Winterhold, that can spawn in the place of goats.\n<br />[*]Adds some diversity to the passive creature spawns in the relevant locations.\n<br />[*]ESL flagged.\n<br />[*]Adds a way to get Powdered Mammoth Tusk without breaking the lore.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[center][color=#6fa8dc][size=3]\xfeff[b]Incompatibilities[/b][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />While the changes made by this plugin are minimal, it does edit two levelled characters so be sure to check your load order for conflicts.
