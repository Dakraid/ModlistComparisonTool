nexusDescription="[center][font=Georgia][color=#f6b26b][size=6][b]Raven Rock Building Tweaks[/b][/size][/color][/font][/center]\n<br />In Raven Rock, some buildings use textures designed for Redoran architecture and some use a more generic stone pattern. For the sake of consistency and visual appeal, I have converted the buildings that used the stone pattern to use Redoran textures instead, which in my opinion looks really nice and makes Raven Rock look more like one cohesive Dunmer settlement. Both interiors and exteriors are affected. Notably, the interiors of these building meshes use Redoran textures for the floors already, so tweaking the texture paths for the walls to match makes the texture transitions much nicer, especially with texture mods.\n<br />\n<br />For those who wish to maintain Bethesda's intention of having these building meshes be relics of the old Nordic settlers or who otherwise don't like the mod's aesthetic, I have included a Fixes Only version that [b]does not retexture[/b]\xa0the buildings but fixes the pathing issues for interior floors and exterior ruins.\n<br />\n<br />This mod[b] does not add any textures or meshes and does not edit textures or meshes[/b]. It simply overrides default texture paths using .esp records for the following meshes:\xa0\x44LC2RRBuilding01, DLC2RRBuildingInt01, DLC2RRBuilding02, DLC2RRBuildingInt02, DLC2RRBuildingInt02Basement, DLC2RRBuilding03, DLC2RRBuildingInt03, DLC2RRBuildingInt03A, and RRRuinsTemp01. This mod is [b]ESL flagged[/b]\xa0\x61nd won't count towards the ESP limit.\n<br />\n<br />[b]This mod is compatible with:\n<br />[/b][color=#00ff00]Every Raven Rock retexture[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]Quaint Raven Rock[/color] [color=#999999][Compatible, but some windows, etc. don't match due to mesh changes. Patch forthcoming.][/color]\n<br />[color=#00ff00]Raven Rock Reimagined\n<br />Raven Rock Reborn\n<br />Raven Rock Enhanced\n<br />Rockin' Raven Rock\n<br />Simple Raven Rock Expansion\n<br />Mnem Raven Rock Expansion Reborn[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]Raven Rock Lighthouse[/color] [color=#999999][Compatible, but the lighthouse doesn't have the texture tweaks. Patch forthcoming.][/color]\n<br />[color=#999999]You should assume that other mods that edit Raven Rock are compatible by default, as this mod is very non-invasive.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b]What Raven Rock textures are being used in these screenshots?[/b]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34292]Rally's Raven Rock[/url]\xfeff, which I strongly recommend (it makes the Bulwark consistent with Redoran architecture too, which is cool.)\xa0Note that the texture paths are vanilla, so my mod will use whatever Raven Rock textures you have installed, or vanilla if you don't have any.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known Issues[/b]\n<br />LOD textures for these buildings haven't been updated, but considering there isn't really anywhere where you can realistically see the LOD version of these meshes because of how Raven Rock and Solstheim in general are laid out, this is really a non-issue.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Future plans\n<br />[/b]Patches to fix minor inconsistencies with Raven Rock Lighthouse and Quaint Raven Rock (nothing's broken if you use these, just a little mismatched.)\n<br />\n<br />[i][center][color=#999999]This mod is Neloth Certified.[/color][/center][/i][center][i]Thank you and enjoy![/i][/center]"
