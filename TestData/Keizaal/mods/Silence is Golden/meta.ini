nexusDescription="I think at some point, everyone's decided they want the Golden Claw. You already have all the other claw keys, and you want to complete the set. Maybe you play Legacy of the Dragonborn and icecreamassassin has compelled you to steal it back. Maybe you just think it looks shiny and you like shiny things.\n<br />\n<br />Whatever your reasons, you dropped a bucket on Lucan's head, picked the claw right off the counter, and walked out with it.\n<br />\n<br />Except that Lucan only has it because you gave it to him. He asked you to find it, you found it, and you gave it back. If you wanted it so badly, why did you give it to him in the first place? Giving it to him so you can steal it back is just a couple of unnecessary extra steps.\n<br />This mod lets you lie about finding the claw to Lucan. You still complete the quest, but he's not your friend and you get no reward except keeping the claw.\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/52904][img]https://i.imgur.com/cET5e0Z.png[/img][/url][/center]"
