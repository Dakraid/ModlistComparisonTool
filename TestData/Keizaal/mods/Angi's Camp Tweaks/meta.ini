nexusDescription="[color=#999999][size=4]Description[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Major changes to Angi's Camp / Archery Practice (dunArcherQST):\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Completing Angi's challenges now gives flat XP bonuses that scale with the challenge difficulty (2400 XP in total).\n<br />[*]You can continue to ask Angi for Practice Arrows when you're running low after completing her challenges.\n<br />[*]You can continue to gain a small amount of XP from practicing at the target range. (Make sure to use the Practice Arrows!)\n<br />[*]Practice Arrows will automatically re-spawn by the target range if you are about to run out.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Minor changes:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Angi will no longer react to you (e.g. \"Be careful!\") when firing your bow.\n<br />[*]Angi will hit the far target accurately when demonstrating (may only affect new games). You may still notice arrows teleporting upwards after they collide; this is an unavoidable issue with how the engine handles AI aiming.\n<br />[*]Angi will correctly start with the middle target and not skip the right target during the final demonstration.\n<br />[*]Angi will consider you a friend after completing the first challenge. You will become an enemy if you threaten her, so don't pick that option if you're planning to use the Ebony Blade.\n<br />[/list]"
