nexusDescription="Immersive Patrols adds a reasonable amount of Stormcloak, Thalmor, Imperial and Dawnguard patrols to Skyrim and a few Skaal, Reaver and Riekling patrols to Solstheim. These patrols often cross paths with each other or the player creating new encounters or unexpected aid. It also includes small Civil War battles and some basic non-Khajiit Caravans who\xa0travel freely between the major cities (excluding Winterhold).\n<br />\n<br />Dawnguard patrols within this mod will only exist after reconstruction of Fort Dawnguard has begun.\n<br />\n<br />Completing the Civil War quest will disable all patrol and battle NPCs (including Thalmor) of the losing faction. Destroying the remaining enemy camps after the Civil War quest is completed will completely disable all Civil War NPCs, effectively ending the Civil War within this mod.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=====What you need to Know=====\n<br />\n<br />Civil War NPCs in this mod will attack you on sight depending on your allegiance.\n<br />Does not use scripts. Feel free to install and uninstall worry free.\n<br />TES5edit cleaned every iteration, no matter how small the change.\n<br />All NPCs respawn besides Caravan NPCs.\n<br />Can be placed anywhere in your load order (except below water mods).\n<br />No Vampires, Werewolves, Khajiit caravans or bandits are included in this mod.\n<br />All enemies scale but only through stats/player level.\n<br />\n<br />=====Known Issues=====\n<br />\n<br />Faction Change: If you join a Civil War faction THEN switch factions during the MSQ (Jagged Crown) or by the use of a mod you will still be seen as the betrayed faction by this mod's NPCs until the NPCs respawn.\n<br />\n<br />Solution: Wait 11 in-game days in an interior to refresh the exterior cells OR\xa0uninstall Immersive Patrols, save the game without it installed and then reinstall Immersive Patrols.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=====Incompatible Mods=====\n<br />\n<br />Nothing so far.\n<br />\n<br />===Other Mods===\n<br />\n<br />\xa0 \xa0\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/2237521?tab=user+files][img]https://i.imgur.com/mzM3ZLW.png[/img][/url]\xfeff\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />===Tip===\n<br />\xa0\xa0[url=https://ko-fi.com/kodadjiin][img]https://i.imgur.com/qej4Nmk.png[/img][/url]"
