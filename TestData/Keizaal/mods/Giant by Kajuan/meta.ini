nexusDescription="[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/6179/6179-1653089997-2111341473.gif[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This is a Giant skin and outfit HD texture overhaul, you can find in \"textures&#92;actors&#92;giant\" folder. Vanilla files, whit the official HD texture installed, were 2k the skin and 1k the outfit. In the SE release I added the loot giant toe clutter.\n<br />\n<br />This mod doesn't change the Giant introduced in the dlc01, the Frozen Giant. It doesn't cover any related mods that alter or introduce a new kind of giants either. This one is the default and unique vanilla Giant that come with a modular outfit contained in a separate texture file in the same folder, the giantoutfit.dds. One more, a simple skirt, it's included in the skin texture giant.dds. In some way the bones contained in those textures cover the ones hanging around in some camps (see screenshot) and maybe something else. \n<br />So, in Skyrim, by default, we have just three possible different dressed Giants overall, and only one kind of skin and look; Frozen Giant a part, they are all twin.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[center][size=3][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/6179/6179-1653090018-1762719122.gif[/img][/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />The release contains four textures files but I had to work six images: two diffuse, two normal maps and their alpha channel. Most are very subtle details, skin, teeth, hair, fingernails, more evident skinned tattoo over the front (it was in the alpha channel but not really visible in the diffuse map), furs, leather, bones, punctured the orbital cavity of the skull [/size][size=3]they wear hanging from strings (as it should be), and so on, practically everything. Couldn't understand what kind of leather the outfit had behind the furs, it was very shiny, I made it sort of reindeer suede and accordingly decreased that effect. I preferred the body skin to be a bit\xa0[size=3]sweaty[/size] and\xa0therefore a little more shiny.\n<br />I have to say that the outfit, despite its beautiful concept art, can't work that great with its massive use of fringed furs. The [/size][size=3]consistency between the alpha and the new fur\xa0[size=3]fringes[/size] took me a lot of time and could need much more.\n<br />I thought I had to work the Club weapon too, as the giants have it always in their hands but I leaved it cause it's in a separate folder ([size=3]weapons folder) and is not bad at all, it is 2k[/size]. Maybe I'll add a more detailed one in the options.\n<br />\n<br />Like for the previous [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/6781714/?tb=mods&amp;pUp=1&amp;tab=user+files]releases[/url], meshes haven't be touched and they are not inside the packages.\n<br />You can preview the results by looking at the screenshot. They refer to the full 4k version with ENB enabled; a few images are about this work on its very first stage, the [url=https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/6179-0-1481756430.jpg]screenshoot23[/url] it's how the full outfit look in the release, while the skin is almost the same from the first stage. They could look different in your setup, so if you see something wrong, please just let me know.\n<br />\n<br />Comments, screenshot and suggestions are really appreciate.\n<br />\n<br />Have fun,\n<br />\n<br />Kaj\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]AP_cDzr69Mc[/youtube] [youtube]RusxZUjdHbY[/youtube]\n<br />[size=2]Video on the left by [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEjvAplB6GaVJjCAwx3fJA]Hodilton[/url]\xa0 - Video on the right by [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7mFkx1Um4KJZKkUHsSV1uA]ShoddyCast[/url][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />DOWNLOAD:\n<br />\n<br />This mod come in four packages: \n<br />\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3][size=3]Giant.4k. [/size]4096x4096 compressed diffuse and normal maps[/size][size=3]. (512 the clutter)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3][size=3]Giant.4k-2k. [/size]4096x4096 compressed diffuse and 2048x2048 compressed normal maps. (512 the clutter)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3][size=3]Giant.2k. [/size]2048x2048 compressed diffuse and normal maps. (512 the clutter)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Giant.1k 1024x1024 compressed diffuse and 1024x1024 compressed normal maps. (256 the clutter)[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />INSTALL and UNINSTALL:\n<br />\n<br />As usual, they are 7zipped fomod installers.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />COMPATIBILITY:\n<br />\n<br />They could not work as intended if you installed some different meshes then the vanilla ones. \n<br />\n<br />Notice: [/size][size=3]for all I know, there is a well known mod that I had installed, \"Skyrim Immersive Creatures\" (by lifestotock), [/size][size=3]I thought it just added new monsters, but really it - exchanges - also the default creatures like, in many cases, right the Giant. I had an head cash to understand why I couldn't find the vanilla Giant to check my textures inside the game. That mod use the vanilla Giant skin, the one I worked, but in the usual locations, it introduces and [size=3]exchanges[/size] some new Giant body shapes and use other armors (and weapons) instead of the default vanilla Giant outfit. There are no side effects, just if you see a Giant with armors or different body shape in the usual places, he's not vanilla and has nothing to do with this release.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />CREDITS and THANKS:\n<br />\n<br />Bethesda.\n<br />Nexusmods.\n<br />The whole modding community.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />TOOLS USED:\n<br />\n<br />DDSopt to extract files.\n<br />Adobe Photoshop to work on textures.\n<br />Nifskope to quick preview the textures over the meshes.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />PERMISSION NOTES:[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]If you show in same way my assets in public places you must and should always credit the author.\n<br />These files are Nexusmod exclusive right now.
