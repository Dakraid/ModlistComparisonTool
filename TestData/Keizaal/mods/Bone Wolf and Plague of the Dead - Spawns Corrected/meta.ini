nexusDescription="[b][center][color=#e06666]What does this mod do?[/color][/center][/b]\n<br />This is an incredibly simple patch that resolves a conflict between the Bone Wolf and Plague of the Dead Creations that prevents the zombies added by Plague of the Dead from spawning as advertised in the Creation's description. That is all.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#e06666][center]Wait, if it is just one record, why release the mod?[/center][/color][/b]\n<br />I released this so that people are actually aware of the conflict and either have a reference to resolve it in their own conflict resolution, or a simple ESL-flagged plugin they can throw into their load order and forget about."
