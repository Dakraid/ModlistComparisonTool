nexusDescription="[center][font=Georgia][color=#c9daf8][size=6][b]Winterhold Keep Tweaks[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#b6b6b6][size=4]for Cities of the North - Winterhold[/size][/color][/font][/center]\n<br />I am a huge fan of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/19519279]JPSteel2[/url]'s [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40088]Cities of the North - Winterhold[/url] and you should be, too. The mod uses new meshes with vanilla texture paths to create a beautiful town that adjusts automatically to your graphical setup. It's got tons of patches, great level design, and really creative features. One design choice that I really liked was changing the Jarl of Winterhold's seat from a generic longhouse to a new fortress in the mountains. However, I noticed a few design choices that I thought could be reworked, such as the use of various other tilesets for certain assets, a sort of clunky name, and some clipping objects, among other things.\n<br />\n<br />Therefore, I created this mod to unify the castle into the Windhelm tileset art style and make a few subjective fixes and tweaks that I believe bring out the best in this beautiful building. This mod contains no textures; just like COTN Winterhold itself, it uses the textures you have installed (Windhelm textures, specifically) to make its tweaks. My screenshots use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21423]Noble Skyrim 2K[/url]. It should be fully compatible with any texture mods you have installed. These tweaks do not affect the base objects that they retexture--only the ones inside the castle itself. The plugin is ESL-flagged and shouldn't take up a plugin slot.\n<br />\n<br />This mod was originally created for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/61720101]Pierre Despereaux[/url]'s [url=https://keizaal.github.io/Keizaal/]Keizaal[/url] Modding Giveaway.\n<br />\n<br />[center][font=Georgia][color=#b6b6b6][size=4]List of Changes[/size][/color][/font][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The castle has been renamed from '[i]Stonecold Fortress[/i]' to '[i]Longwinter Watch[/i]'. I'm sorry, Mr. Austin.\n<br />[*]The castle's upstairs area has been renamed from '[i]Stonecold Fortress, Upstairs[/i]' to '[i]Longwinter Upstairs[/i]'.\n<br />[*]You can now see up to the top of the stairwell tower. Cobwebs were added to the top.\n<br />[*]There is now a railing on the balcony at the top of the stairwell. The balcony floor has been slightly adjusted.\n<br />[*]Various hay bales were moved around to stop them from clipping into walls.\n<br />[*]Korir's bed is no longer stuffed with hay and hay does not clip through the headboard.\n<br />[*]The statue of Ysgramor in Korir's bedroom has been replaced by a more relevant statue of Mara.\n<br />[*]The stairwell now uses Windhelm textures for stairs and platforms, instead of Castle Volkihar textures.\n<br />[*]The firepits and platforms in Korir's bedroom now use Windhelm textures instead of Farmhouse textures.\n<br />[*]The large platforms in the great hall now use Windhelm textures instead of Sovngarde textures.\n<br />[*]The pedestals used for trophy bases now use Windhelm textures instead of Whiterun textures.\n<br />[*]Various stairs inside and outside the keep now use Windhelm textures instead of High Hrothgar textures.\n<br />[*]The arches/gatehouses outside the keep no longer have Ancient Nord portcullises.\n<br />[*]Korir's bedroom no longer has Nord rubble poking through a certain section of the floor.\n<br />[*]Korir's throne no longer has another throne layered on top of it. [i]Thrones of Skyrim[/i] compatible.\n<br />[*]A wooden ladder in the great hall that apparently went nowhere has been disabled.\n<br />[*]Because hiking up to the castle takes quite a while, there is now an unlockable map marker for it.\n<br />[*][b][color=#ffff00]NEW![/color][/b] Korir no longer has a staff and soul gems in his quarters. Thanks to VictorF.\n<br />[*][b][color=#ffff00]NEW![/color][/b]\xa0The castle now automatically has a unique map marker if you are using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56123]Common Marker Addon Project[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />This mod obviously requires Cities of the North - Winterhold. All credit to JPSteel2 for the excellent base mod. I hope you'll all enjoy these customizations!"
