nexusDescription="If you were to actually make a poison (do not actually make poison), you'd probably pick the most poisonous things you could think of to use as a base. With Skyrim's ingredients, this works fine for plants. But you'll notice pretty quickly that none of the enemies who attack you with their own venom - Frostbite Spiders and Chaurus mainly - give you a venomous ingredient. You get little bottles of Frostbite Venom, but that seems like a waste since it bypasses the Alchemy system so completely and they aren't even good.\n<br />\n<br />Toxic adds 4 new ingredients that can be harvested from poisonous enemies. Each of these has poisonous effects and can be used to devastate other enemies. These ingredients are:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Spider Venom Sac - harvested from Frostbite Spiders and found in merchant leveled lists.\n<br />[*]Chaurus Venom Sac - harvested from Chaurus of all types and found in merchant leveled lists.\n<br />[*]Spriggan Nectar - harvested from Spriggans and found in merchant leveled lists.\n<br />[*]Afflicted Bile - harvested from the Afflicted.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Excepting Afflicted Bile, which is simply too toxic to have any positive effects, each new ingredient can also be used to create anti-venomous compounds.\n<br />\n<br />A Hunterborn patch is available here:\xa0https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58185/\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/52904][img]https://i.imgur.com/cET5e0Z.png[/img][/url][/center]"
