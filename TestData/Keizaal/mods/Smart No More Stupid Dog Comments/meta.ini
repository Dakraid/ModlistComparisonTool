nexusDescription="[center][/center][center][font=Comic Sans MS][color=#a61c00][size=6][i]Smart[/i][/size][/color][/font][font=Comic Sans MS][color=#ff7700][size=6] No more Stupid Dog Comments![/size][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=#ffe599]Tired of friendly NPC's forever saying \"Stupid dog!\" to your furry friend?[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#fff2cc]Tired of no-one [i]ever [/i]saying [i]anything [/i]to your Dawnguard dogs?[/color]!\n<br />\n<br />Then you need this! \n<br />\n<br />[font=Tahoma][u]DIALOGUE RULES[/u][/font]\n<br />\n<br />Friendly NPC's (Spouses, Housecarls, adopted children and NPC's with a good disposition towards the Player) will say \"Good dog!\" to your pet[i] provided [/i]the dog is friendly towards the Player.\n<br />\n<br />Unfriendly NPC's or those [i]not[/i] disposed towards the Player OR if the dog is [i]not [/i][i] [/i]friendly, NPC's will continue to\xa0 say \"Stupid dog!\" as per normal.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]DLC player home house bards and [size=5]DLC player home[/size] carriage drivers will always be friendly to player owned dogs.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Dawnguard faction NPC's (not vampires) are always friendly toward Dawnguard dogs (Bran, Sceolang) \n<br />\n<br />[size=3][i][u]Note:[/u] [/i]this mod mostly affects player owned/player follower dogs, NPC's who have follower dogs will possibly still behave just as badly towards them as ever. [/size][/size][size=5]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][size=4][color=#b6d7a8][color=#ffffff][u][color=#00ffff][size=5]Update 1.1[/size][/color][/u]\n<br />[color=#fff2cc]Added ESPFE version\n<br />NPC's Ardwen and dog (WEJS13), Hunter and Dog (WEJS21) and \xfeff[size=5][size=4][size=5][size=4]Barleydark Farm[/size][/size][/size][/size]'s Mithorpa Nasya\n<br /> (Cutting Room Floor) will now say \"Good Dog!\" to their respective follower dogs/farm dogs too.[/color][/color][/color][/size][/size]\n<br />[size=4]Just overwrite any previous versions no special action necessary.[/size]\n<br />[size=2]P.S. thanks for the donation you know who you are though not sure if it was for this version or LE :)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]~~~~~~~~[/size]\n<br />[color=#b6d7a8]How to install:[/color]\n<br />[size=4]Just install with mod manager or drop the files in manually.[/size]\n<br />[color=#b6d7a8]How to remove:[/color]\n<br />[size=4]Use your mod managers uninstaller or remove manually. No special steps necessary.[/size]\n<br />[size=5][size=4][color=#b6d7a8]Does this mean that NPC's will finally acknowledge my Dawnguard dogs exist? Really?!\n<br />[/color][/size][/size][size=4]Yes, yes it does. NPC's will say \"Good dog!\" or \"Stupid dog!\" now (see exceptions above)[/size]\n<br />[color=#b6d7a8]Is it safe to remove?[/color]\n<br />[size=4]There are no scripts and nothing is baked into the savegame so it should be safe to remove at any time.[/size]\n<br />[color=#b6d7a8]Is it compatible?[/color]\n<br />[size=4]It should be compatible with anything that doesn't modify dog dialogue.[/size]\n<br />[size=5][size=4][color=#b6d7a8]How does it work? Does it use vanilla voices?![/color][/size][/size]\n<br />[size=5][size=4][size=5][size=4][size=5][size=4]It does indeed use vanilla voices. All non-unique voices have \"Good dog!\" lines recorded but you rarely get a chance to hear them, if ever. This mod adds extra checks to the dialogue so you finally get a chance to hear the already existing lines often for the first time, thats it.[/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][size=4] Its also been patched for Dawnguard dogs.[/size]\n<br />[size=5][size=4][size=4][color=#b6d7a8][color=#00ff00]Is it compatible with [i]your[/i] other mods especially[i] Improved Adoptions[/i]?[/color]\n<br />[/color][/size][/size][size=4]Absolutely! It wouldn't be much use if it wasn't![/size][/size][size=4] It was originally conceived as part of that mod but I decided to make it a separate mod so everyone can use it.[/size]\n<br />[color=#93c47d]What if its not compatible with x,y,z mod that does affects dog dialogue?[/color]\n<br />[size=4]If you're lucky I might introduce a patch. No guarantees though. So be nice, ok?[/size]\n<br />[color=#93c47d]Does it work with Hearthfires adopted kids? I'm sick of them saying \"Stupid dog!\" right after they asked for a pet![/color]\n<br />[size=4]Yep, me too. It should do, if not there something up with their faction i.d.'s..[/size]\n<br />[color=#93c47d]Is it compatible with mods that add extra pet animals?[/color]\n<br />[size=4]To be honest I'm not sure. [/size]\n<br />[size=4]If they don't touch vanilla dog dialogue probably, otherwise I really don't know.[/size]\n<br />[color=#b6d7a8]So...I need Arthmoor's Cutting Room Floor for this mod?![/color]\n<br />[size=4]Nope, Barleydark Farm faction and Mithorpa Nasyal are vanilla objects they're in the base game files so everyone has them. Bethesda never added them to the game world which is where CRF comes in. If its not installed they'll just be ignored.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cc0000]Help! They're still saying \"Stupid Dog\" to Meeko / other dog! Whats going on?[/color]\n<br />[size=4]Did you make Meeko / other dog your follower? Until then their disposition towards you is low and NPC's will be unfriendly until the dog's disposition towards you is raised (make him a follower)\xa0[/size][/size][/center]"
