nexusDescription="Blended Roads is an amazing improvement to the roads of Skyrim. However, the edited meshes have inadvertently caused a couple of minor bugs and visual oddities. After skimming through the Blended Roads comment section, there were a couple of fixes pointed out that I've decided to patch up with this mod.\n<br />\n<br />The plugin for this mod is flagged as ESL, so it shouldn't take up a slot in your load order.\n<br />\n<br />This fix is made for use with Blended Roads' \"Really Blended\" option, \n<br />OR\n<br />Cathedral Landscapes, which uses Blended Roads' assets.\n<br />\n<br />CREDITS:\n<br />\n<br />T4GTR43UM3R - For the original mod.\n<br />ezfreee - For the Whiterun entrance fix.\n<br />grc472 - For the bear trap fix."
