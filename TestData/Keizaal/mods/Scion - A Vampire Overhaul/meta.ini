nexusDescription="[center][color=#dd7e6b][size=5][b]Scion - A Vampire O[/b][b]v[b]erhaul[/b][/b][/size][/color][/center][size=5][b][color=#9fc5e8]\n<br />[/color][/b][/size]\xa0Scion is a complete overhaul of Skyrim\x2019s Vampire system designed to balance existing Vampire mechanics and add powerful new vampiric abilities to the game.\xa0Vanilla Vampirism is neither deep nor engaging. Its passives and Greater Powers are weighted towards Stage 4, meaning the quickest way to \"level up\" is to simply ignore Vampirism entirely. Many Vampire overhauls successfully address this. However, those overhauls often come loaded with features such as age mechanics, new schools of magic, race-specific passives, and open-ended quests.\xa0\x42y contrast, Scion provides a minimalistic and streamlined overhaul of the four stages of Vampirism, designed to make both Stage 1 and Stage 4 desirable for different builds. It also overhauls the Vampire Lord\x2019s level-based scaling and its perk tree to ensure that the Vampire Lord is viable throughout the late game.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#dd7e6b][size=4]Mortal Form\xa0[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />All Vampires benefit from the following passive abilities, based on the stage of their Vampirism. In general, both buffs and debuffs grow stronger as the Vampire progresses towards Stage 4. However, some passives are independent of stage, allowing Stage 1 Vampires to access them at full strength without restricting Stage 4 Vampires from doing the same. In addition, I have restored the Vanilla mechanic of becoming \"hated and feared\" as a Stage 4 Vampire.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#dd7e6b][b][Spoiler]Dark Stalker - [/b]You are 25% harder to detect while sneaking, and you deal 25% more damage with sneak attacks and spells.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Undeath -[/b] You resist 0/10/25/50% of incoming weapon damage, but healing spells and potions are 0/25/50/75% less effective.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Unnatural Resistance -[/b] Your Vampiric blood grants you 25/50/75/100% Frost Resistance, and 100% Poison and Disease Resistance.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Weakness to Fire -[/b] Your Fire Resistance is reduced by 25/50/75/100%.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Weakness to Sunlight -[/b] You have 0/25/50/75 less Health, Magicka, and Stamina and you cannot regenerate Health, Magicka, or Stamina while standing in sunlight.[/Spoiler][/color]\n<br />[b][color=#dd7e6b][size=4]Vampiric Powers\xa0\n<br />[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Vampires have access to a number of spells and powers. Generally speaking, Greater Powers are weighted towards Stage 1, so you must feed to maintain access to them. By contrast, Vampiric Drain grows stronger as you progress to Stage 4, allowing Stage 4 Vampires to heal without relying on potions or Restoration spells.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#dd7e6b][b][Spoiler][i]All Vampires have the following abilities:\xa0\n<br />[/i]\n<br />Vampiric Drain -[/b] Absorb 5/10/15/20 Health per second from the target.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Hunter\x2019s Sight -[/b] For 60 seconds, you have improved night vision and you can detect nearby living creatures.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Vampire\x2019s Seduction -[/b]\xa0Surround yourself in a seductive aura for 60 seconds. Activating a target places them under your command for 1 hour.\n<br />\n<br />[b][i]At Stage 1, Vampires gain the following ability:\xa0[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Champion of the Night -\xa0[/b]Surround yourself with a cloud of vampire bats, draining 12 points of Health, Magicka, and Stamina per second for 60 seconds.\n<br />\n<br />[b][i]At Stage 1 and 2, Vampires gain the following ability:[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Embrace of Shadows - [/b]Cloak yourself in shadows, becoming invisible for 60 seconds. Attacking or activating an object will not break this effect.\n<br />\n<br />[b][i]At Stage 1, 2, and 3, Vampires gain the following ability:[/i]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[b]Reign of Terror - [/b]Manifest your vampiric presence, causing the living to flee for 60 seconds.[/Spoiler][/color]\n<br />[b][color=#dd7e6b][size=4]Vampire Lord [/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />In the Vanilla game, Vampire Lords gain extra Health, Magicka, Stamina, Armor Rating, and Unarmed Damage based on your PC's level. I have increased the scaling for each of these stats to ensure that Vampire Lords are competitive in the late game. In addition, I have added up to 50% Magic Resist to the level-based scaling mechanic. I have also increased the magnitude of the reanimation spell, significantly buffed the Drain Life spell, and removed a bizarre feature where the spell would be significantly weakened whenever Serana followed you into battle. Vampire Lords also have 100% Poison &amp; Disease Resistance, 100% Frost Resistance, and 100% Weakness to Fire.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />In addition to these general changes, I have also overhauled the Vampire Lord perk tree. Perks such as Nightwalker, Unearthly Will, and Empowering Claws focus on enhancing the combat potential of the Vampire Lord. Perks such as Blood Magic, Night Power, and Dark Servant grant your Vampire Lord new spells and powers. And perks such as Ancient Thirst and Dread Harvest increase the power of your Drain spells, whether you cast them as a Vampire Lord or not. Drain spells added by Mysticism will benefit from these perks without a patch.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#dd7e6b][b][Spoiler]Nightwalker (2/2):[/b] You deal 25/50% extra damage as a Vampire Lord. \n<br />\n<br />[b]Unearthly Will:[/b] You gain 100 extra Health, Magicka, and Stamina as a Vampire Lord.\n<br />[b]Power of the Grave:[/b] You have 100 extra armor and 25% extra Magic Resist as a Vampire Lord.\n<br />[b]Empowering Claws:[/b] Melee attacks as a Vampire Lord absorb Magicka.\n<br />[b]Blood Scion:[/b] When you enter combat as a Vampire Lord, you are surrounded in a cloak of bats that feed on your enemies.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Ancient Thirst:[/b] Spells that absorb Health cost 25% less Magicka.\n<br />[b]Potent Blood (2/2):[/b] Spells that absorb Health are 25/50% stronger.\n<br />[b]Dread Harvest:[/b] Spells that absorb Health are up to twice as strong, based on the target\x2019s missing Health.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]Blood Magic:[/b] As a Vampire Lord, you can cast the spells Vampiric Grip and Corpse Curse. \n<br />[b]Night Power: [/b]As a Vampire Lord, you can cast the spells Mist Form and Supernatural Reflexes.\n<br />[b]Dark Servant[/b]: As a Vampire Lord, you can cast the spell Conjure Gargoyle and command one additional minion.[/Spoiler][/color]\n<br />[color=#dd7e6b][size=5][b]Installation\xa0[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Scion requires a new game, or a save where you have never become a Vampire. I will not offer [b]any\xa0[/b]support for users who attempt to install this mod on a game where they already have Vampirism.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#dd7e6b][size=5][b]Compatibility\xa0[/b][/size][/color][size=5][b]\n<br />[/b][/size]\n<br />Scion is a streamlined Vampire overhaul that only touches records relevant to Vampires and Vampire Lords. Scion will be incompatible with any mod that that changes Vampires. However, it will not cause compatibility issues with any other mods. Furthermore, Scion does not touch any \"race\" records and will not cause any black face bugs.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#dd7e6b][size=5]My Other Mods[/size][/color][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549]\n<br />[/url][/b]\n<br />[b][size=2][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686]Aetherius - A Race Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411]Mundus - A Standing Stone Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839]Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191]Adamant - A Perk Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487]Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549]Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul\n<br />[/url][/size][/b][b][color=#9fc5e8][size=2][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639]Scion - A Vampire Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746]Manbeast - A Werewolf Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130]Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099]Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul\xa0\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138]Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790][size=2]Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon[/size][/url][/size][/color][/b]"
