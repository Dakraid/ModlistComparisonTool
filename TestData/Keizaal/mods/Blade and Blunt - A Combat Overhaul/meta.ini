nexusDescription="[center][color=#9fc5e8][size=6][b]Blade and Blunt - A Combat O[/b][b]verhaul[/b][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />[size=2]Blade and Blunt is a complete overhaul of Skyrim\x2019s combat designed to increase the game\x2019s difficulty and encourage active resource management. Unlike other combat overhauls, it does not seek to import mechanics from other games into Skyrim. Instead, it enhances the existing mechanics of Skyrim\x2019s combat and focuses on tightening the gameplay to allow for more player skill and RPG-like character development.\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=5][b]Requirements\xa0[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />Blade and Blunt requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444]Address Library for SKSE Plugins[/url] to be installed. Blade &amp; Blunt is compatible with both pre-AE (1.5.97) and post-AE (1.6+) versions of Skyrim. The same DLL is used for both versions.[/size]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />Blade and Blunt also requires[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869] Spell Perk Item Distributor[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43532]Scrambled Bugs[/url]. These two mods allow Blade &amp; Blunt to distribute perks to every NPC in the game, and to maintain patchless compatibility with mods such as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137]Ordinator[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191]Adamant[/url]. A list of \x201crecommended settings\x201d for Scrambled Bugs is included at the bottom of this mod page.[/size]\n<br />[size=2]\xa0[/size]\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=5][b]Resource Management\xa0[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Managing your resources is an important part of combat in Blade and Blunt. You will no longer regenerate Stamina while attacking or blocking, and drawing a bow will slowly drain your Stamina. In addition, the Stamina cost of various actions such as power attacking, bashing, and blocking an attack has been adjusted.[/size]\n<br />[size=2]\xa0[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Compared to Vanilla, Magicka and Stamina will regenerate faster in combat. Both resources will continue to regenerate very quickly when outside of combat. Health will also regenerate slightly faster outside of combat.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]When you fall below 0 Stamina, your character will move and attack 25% slower, deal 25% less damage with weapons, and be 50% less effective at blocking. This debuff will also apply to NPCs.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=5]Advantage\xa0[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Blade and Blunt rewards the player for seizing the advantage against their opponents and striking them while they are power attacking, drawing a bow, or casting a spell. Attacking with advantage increases your damage by 50%, and works with hand to hand combat, melee weapons, bows, and spells. Ward spells negate the benefits of advantage for both the player and NPCs.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=5][b]Stagger\xa0[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />Blade and Blunt improves the game\x2019s stagger mechanics by ensuring that every power attack produces a stagger. Stagger comes in four different magnitudes.[/size]\n<br />[size=2]   [/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]25% Stagger - Power attacks with fists* and daggers\xa0\xa0\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*]50% Stagger - Power attacks with swords, axes, and maces; weapon and shield bashes -\xa0\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*]75% Stagger - Power attacks with greatswords, battleaxes, and warhammers; power\xa0 bashes with shields\xa0\n<br />[/list][size=2]\n<br />In addition, any power attack or bash executed with advantage will deliver a 100% stagger, and you deal 50% extra damage when attacking a staggered target. Wards reduce all incoming stagger by 50%, and some very large targets (dragons, centurions, lurkers, giants, and mammoths) also resist stagger.[/size]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />All sources of staggers in Blade and Blunt have a five second cooldown per target. This cooldown is shared among all sources of stagger.[/size]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />Adamant also includes three perks (Determination, Power Shot, and Impact) which provide stagger effects to shields, bows, and spells, respectively. Each of these staggers is a 50% stagger with a five second cooldown.\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]*Note: Hand to Hand power attacks can only stagger if the invisible \x201cunarmed weapon\x201d is equipped. Ordinator, Vokrii, and Adamant all equip the \x201cunarmed weapon\x201d to your character in the background when you have two free hands.\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=5][b]Speed, Reach, and Attack Commitment [/b]\xa0[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]The player will now move in a slower, more realistic fashion, especially when their weapon is drawn. They will also move slower while attacking, power attacking, drawing a bow, or casting a spell. In addition, weapon reach has been reduced to be more in line with in-game models. Both attack commitment and the reach changes apply to all humanoid NPCs. I recommend combining this mod with Mortal Enemies for the time being to apply attack commitment to animals. I do not recommend combining this mod with other mods that reduce weapon reach.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]In addition to these changes, Two-handed weapons will swing slightly faster than in Vanilla, and the player\x2019s height no longer affects their movement speed.\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=5]Blocking and Parrying\xa0[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Blade and Blunt increases the base power of blocking with a shield to 50%, and the base power of blocking with weapons to 25%. However, weapons have access to a parry mechanic, which is an interpretation of the timed block mechanic found in other combat overhauls. Blocking with a weapon doubles your block effectiveness for one second. Targets who attack you during this window suffer a light (25%) stagger with a five second cooldown per target. (The increased blocking effectiveness does not have a cooldown.)\xa0[/size]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />Blocking is no longer controlled by the Magic Resistance cap. Blocking now caps at 90%. You can adjust this value with the Game Setting fBlockMax.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=5][b]Resistance and Armor Rating[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Magic Resistance, Fire Resistance, Frost Resistance, Shock Resistance and Poison Resistance all cap out at 75%. In addition, Spell Absorption now respects the Magic Resistance cap of 75%.\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Each point of Armor Rating reduces incoming damage by 0.15%, up to 75% damage reduction at 500 Armor Rating. This represents the \x201csoft cap\x201d for Armor Rating. Increasing your Armor Rating beyond 500 reduces incoming damage by 0.03% per point, up to a total reduction of 90% damage reduction at 1000 Armor Rating. This represents the \x201chard cap\x201d for Armor Rating.\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]While the jump from 0.15% to 0.03% might seem extreme at first, the additive nature of Armor Rating means that the first 500 points provides you with 75% \x201creal mitigation,\x201d while the next 500 points provide you with 60% extra \x201creal mitigation.\x201d This change allows Heavy Armor builds to benefit from very high levels of Armor Rating while maintaining the balance of the existing armor system for light armor and robes users.\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]In addition, Blade and Blunt eliminates the \x201chidden\x201d Armor Rating granted when equipping light or heavy armor, and ensures that Armor Rating reduces the damage from perks such as Hack and Slash and Rip and Tear in Adamant for both the player and NPCs.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=5][b]Game Settings and Combat Styles\xa0[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Many changes have been made to game settings and combat styles that provide subtle improvements to the combat experience. These changes largely focus on combat mechanics such as blocking, bashing, and combat regeneration. Enemies will be more aggressive, and more intelligent, with Blade and Blunt installed. You may wish to ensure that Blade and Blunt loads lower than any other mod that changes these game settings or combat styles.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=5][b]Combat Difficulty\xa0[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]The various game difficulties have been adjusted to provide increased lethality, while still giving players control over their own experience. Please be sure to select the difficulty you find most enjoyable in play, rather than the difficulty that you are used to playing with. The difficulty modifiers are:[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Novice: 1.5x Damage Dealt / 0.5x Damage Received[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Apprentice: 1.25x Damage Dealt / 1x Damage Received\xa0[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Adept: 1x Damage Dealt / 1.5x Damage Received\xa0[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Expert: 0.75x Damage Dealt / 2x Damage Received\xa0[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Master: 0.5x Damage Dealt / 2.5x Damage Received[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Legendary: 0.25x Damage Dealt / 3.0x Damage Received\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]For players who wish to benefit from Blade and Blunt\x2019s expanded combat mechanics, but who find combat too difficult for their liking, I have provided an optional addon that reverts these numbers to their Vanilla values.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=4]Kill Moves\xa0[/size]\n<br />[/color][/b]\n<br />[size=2]With Blade and Blunt installed, the player will be immune to kill moves. While cinematic executions are fun when used on NPCs, allowing them to affect the PC often prevents players from surviving difficult encounters through skill and good play. Additionally, kill moves will only trigger on enemies who are below 50% Health, to account for a bug where enemy armor is not taken into account when the game decides to trigger a kill move.\xa0[/size][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=5]Blade and Blunt - Sneak Addon\xa0[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Blade and Blunt comes with an optional addon that drains your Stamina by five points per second whenever you are moving while in stealth. In addition, this plugin reduces the effectiveness of sneaking by 50% when your Stamina is depleted.\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=5][b]Scrambled Bugs Settings[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Scrambled Bugs comes with a number of optional settings. Users sometimes find themselves unsure of which options to enable for their load order. I recommend activating the following settings in Scrambled Bugs. Note that while I am only including settings that directly relate to my mods, I am assuming that you\x2019re using all of Simonrim for these suggestions.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Quick Shot - Adamant implements Quick Shot differently, so I recommend setting this to \x201c\x66\x61lse.\x201d[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Accumulating Magnitude - This setting makes wards scale like other spells.[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Improve Multiple Enchantment Effects - Fixes the Chaos enchantment.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Leveled Characters - Makes Very Hard enemies in Arena less annoying.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Perk Entry Points: Apply Multiple Spells - Makes perk entry points such as Apply Combat Hit Spell more compatible and more versatile.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Poison Resistance - Allows for new functionality in Apothecary 1.3.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Power Attack Stamina - Prevents the player and NPCs from power attacking without the required Stamina. Makes Frost magic and other Stamina-damaging effects much more useful. Highly recommended.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Reflect Damage - Allows Reflect Damage to scale above 100%, which is necessary since it\x2019s a weak effect.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Scroll Experience - Get magic school XP when using scrolls!\xa0[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Staff Experience - Get magic school XP when using staves![/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=5][b]Compatibility\xa0[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Blade and Blunt is designed to be a total combat package. However, some users will likely wish to combine Blade and Blunt with other mods. In general, whatever mod is loaded last will \x201cwin\x201d conflicts. Load Blade and Blunt after Mortal Enemies if you choose to keep Mortal Enemies in your load order, as it will affect non-humanoid NPCs which are not touched by Blade and Blunt.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Blade and Blunt includes the Modern Brawl Bug Fix by Enai Siaion. Modding tools will thus indicate that Blade and Blunt conflicts with other mods that contain the Brawl Bug fix. However, you can safely ignore this conflict. It does not matter which mod wins, since they all contain the same fix.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=5][b]My Other Mods[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686]Aetherius - A Race Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411]Mundus - A Standing Stone Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839]Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191]Adamant - A Perk Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487]Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549]Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul\n<br />[/url][/size][size=2][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639]Scion - A Vampire Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746]Manbeast - A Werewolf Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130]Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099]Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul\xa0\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138]Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790][size=2]Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon[/size][/url][/size]"
