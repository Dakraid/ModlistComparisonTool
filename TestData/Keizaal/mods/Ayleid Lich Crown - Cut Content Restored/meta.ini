nexusDescription="[center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Were you disappointed when you killed the new\xa0\x41yleid Lich added by the\xa0\x41nniversary Edition Creation Club release The Cause,\n<br /> and found that the quite nice unique crown he was wearing\xa0throughout the fight disintegrated\xa0\x61long with his corpse?\n<br />\n<br />Well guess what it was supposed to be, if you look through the files you will find that the crown is in the files but is lacking a model and unobtainable.\n<br />\n<br />This mod fixes that, it extracts\xa0the crown from the corpse and\xa0\x61\x64\x61pts it so there is a wearable\xa0version\xa0\n<br />\xa0\x66or all the humanoid and beast races, and has model with collision if dropped.\n<br />\n<br />It also makes the Lich drop it upon death, all you need to do is loot the crown from its ashes.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to\xa0Jelidity for her help and fixes,\n<br />as well as the\xa0texture colour adjustments to\n<br /> make the crown more accurately\xa0match the\xa0staff\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4569617?tab=user+files]Please go check out her stuff\xa0[/url]\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Requirements[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod requires[b] Anniversary Edition[/b]\n<br />or more accurately\xa0[b]The Cause\xa0[/b]\n<br />but if you want more than one thing it will work \n<br />out much cheaper to just buy [b]Anniversary Edition [/b]as a whole\n<br />its pretty good value[/center]"
