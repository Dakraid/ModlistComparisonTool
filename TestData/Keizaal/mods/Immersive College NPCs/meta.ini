nexusDescription="[b][color=#6d9eeb][size=6]IMMERSIVE COLLEGE NPCS[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/598980]SomethingObscure[/url]\xa0is now co-author of this mod, since I won't have the time or equipment to work on it at this time.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00](There is now a version for the XBOX One)[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]If you're anything like me and love playing a mage, then you've probably visited the College of Winterhold...\n<br />\n<br />Maybe you came to Special Edition thinking you'd be able to run around Hogwarts, the Arcane University, or\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17004]Immersive College of Winterhold[/url]? (Awesome mod for the original Skyrim.)  Did you notice a lack of security? Perhaps you wondered where all the workers at Saarthal went or why they didn't care to defend their little project? A lack of students? (Come on Bethesda! 3 students? It's a college!)\n<br />\n<br />I searched the web for mods that might change this in a way that wasn't immersion breaking, but ended up making my own mod.  Now they take security a bit more seriously, and Students feel safe enough to stay at the College.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]WHAT THIS DOES[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]It adds a bunch of NPCs to the College as well as Saarthal Exterior. They all have things to do and will wander around and use idles/furniture and workstations.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#00ff00]I also HIGHLY RECOMMEND[/color][/b] you check out [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514]Obscure's College of Winterhold[/url]\xfeff. This adds dorms for all the npcs in this mod as well as some realistic touches for even more immersion!\n<br />\n<br />No unique dialogue atm! Will probably implement soon![/size]\n<br />[size=5]\n<br />[/size][center][size=5]NPCS ADDED[/size]\n<br />[size=3]\xa0[/size]\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][b][size=5]COLLEGE[/size]\n<br />[/b][/color]\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]5 Novices:[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=3][b]Onuja[/b][/size] - Male Argonian\n<br />[size=3][b]Nelysa[/b][/size] - Female Dunmer\n<br />[size=3][b]Sameth[/b][/size] - Male Breton\n<br />[size=3][b]Myvrana[/b][/size] - Female Bosmer\n<br />[b][size=3]Melker[/size][/b] - Male Nord\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#b4a7d6]3 Mages:[/color]\n<br />[/size][b][size=3]Lentilus Batiatus[/size][/b] - Male Imperial, Conjurer, Lone wolf\n<br />[b][size=3]Amanra Solas[/size][/b] - Female Redguard, Restoration Expert, teaches\n<br />[size=3][b]Tarakel[/b][/size] - Male Redguard, teaches wards, makes trips to Saarthal during weekends\n<br />[size=4][color=#6aa84f]\n<br />1 Groundskeeper:[/color]\n<br />[/size][size=3][b]Vaktis\n<br />[/b][/size]\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4]8 College Guardians[/size][/color]\n<br />4 on walls and 4 on the ground\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][size=5][b]Saarthal Excavation[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=3][b]5 workers[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3][b]3 Guardians\n<br />1 Adorable Dog\n<br />[/b][/size][/center]\n<br />[size=5]UPDATES[/size]\n<br />[size=5]Version 1.1.0[/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]This new version has been reformatted as an ESP-FE plugin, which essentially makes it a new mod.\xa0 Because of this it's been renamed to ICNs_ImmersiveCollegeNPCs.esp to avoid confusion between the two versions.\xa0 All existing patches have been updated and renamed as well.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Because ICNs contained only NPCs, AI schedules, and markers, switching from the old version to the ESP-FE version should have no effect on your save game.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Please check out the full change log in the drop-down in the menus at the top of this page, or by clicking on the version number before downloading the file.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]A new \"Lite\" version patch is now offered for those who had framerate troubles in the Courtyard due to Atronachs.\xa0 Please let us know if this helps.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Character Facegeoms and Tintmasks have been built with the following resources: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18147]Ultimate Eye Meshes Ruhmastered[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31665]Better Makeup for SKSE[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18783]ENB Brow Fix[/url], and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19164]Seamless Males[/url].[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]All conflicts with USSEP and Immersive College of Winterhold have been resolved.\xa0 A full compatibility and conflicts list is forthcoming.\xa0[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5]Version 1.0.4[/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Fixed issues with missing FaceGen files.
