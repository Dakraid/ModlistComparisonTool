nexusDescription="[size=5][center][b][color=#9fc5e8]\n<br />Survival Mode Improved\n<br />[/color][/b][/center][/size][b][color=#ffff00]IMPORTANT:[/color][/b][size=3] If you are adding this to a save where survival mode is already running:\n<br />\n<br />BEFORE INSTALLING, please toggle survival mode off in the menu. Exit the pause menu and wait a moment, then make a save. \n<br />Then you should be good to install the mod and load the save you just made.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ffff00]This is very important[/color][/b], as it allows the properties on all of the quest to have their appropriate items attached.\n<br />\n<br />Also, please [color=#ffff00][b]DO NOT[/b][/color] use any other mods that overwrite the Survival Mode scripts. Especially the main script. They are incompatible.\n<br />This includes \"Survival Mode Prompt Removed\".\n<br />\n<br />[/size][center][url=https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4242575][img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreDespereaux/PierreDespereaux/master/assets/images/Xbox%20Tiny.png[/img][/url]\xa0[color=#6aa84f][size=5][url=https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4242575]Available on Xbox\xa0[/url]\xfeff[/size][/color]\xfeff[/center]\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=4][b]Overview[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Over the past year or so that I spent working on SunHelm, I have learned alot about how I want a needs mod to be balanced. [/size]\n<br />[size=3]After trying it out, I have to say, Survival Mode needs a lot of TLC on that front. It does a lot of really cool things. However, the inconsistencies and balance problems really kept it from reaching its full potential in my eyes. With [/size][b]Survival Mode becoming free for everyone to own soon[/b][size=3], I figured it was time I gave it some attention.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]There are quite a few changes and rebalances. I'll list some of the bigger changes below.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Needed changes from the Unofficial CC Survival Mode patch have been integrated into this mod[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Seasons![/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]There have been many changes to the cold/hunger/exhaustion system to bring it in line with SunHelm\x2019s as much as possible. I will elaborate on these changes in their own section below.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]All needs will have a bit of randomness for their progression, as they now have about a 10% variability to how much they will progress from their standard amount. (ie. If a need progresses at 10 points an hour in a normal scenario, it may progress anywhere between 9 and 11 points)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Integrated compatibility for camping mod heat sources.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=#cfe2f3][size=3]Tldr:[/size][/color][size=3] Survival Mode improved brings lots of balance tweaks and improvements. There has been heavy changes to Survival Mode to bring it in line with how [i]I[/i] believe a needs mod should play. Gameplay balance should be somewhat similar to SunHelm. So if you like that mod, hopefully you will enjoy this one as well for other reasons.[/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=4][b]Requirements[/b][/size][/color]   [b]\n<br />\n<br />   [size=3]\xfeff\xfeff\xfeff-[/size][/b][size=3]\xa0[b]CC Survival Mode[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][color=#9fc5e8]Compatibility, Load Order and Integration[/color][/b]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3][b]-This mod is incompatible with any of the other CC Survival Mode overhauls.\n<br />\n<br />-Load higher in your load order and patch for conflicts if need be.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]-[/b] Integrated compatibility with Campfire and Campsite heat sources. You no longer need a patch for these.\n<br />[b]-[/b] Integrated Compatibility for Pilgrim\x2019s prayer functionality with Survival Mode\x2019s pay to pray has also been added.\n<br /> [b]-\xa0[/b]Several weathers from \x201cObsidian Weathers and Seasons\x201d were being treated as comfortable even though the weather was a bit snowy. Survival Mode now correctly takes these into consideration.[/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />Otherwise, compatibility remains the same as normal Survival Mode. As with normal Survival Mode, it is pretty imperative that conflicts between armor records and food be resolved.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=4][b]Cold[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]The biggest changes in this mod go to the cold system. There have been numerous balance changes from timings and rate, to the amount of warmth gained when near a heat source. Some of these are listed below.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][b]-[/b]\xa0[size=3]Overall, a bigger emphasis is placed upon weather than before. Progression should match SunHelm\x2019s cold pretty closely.\n<br />   \xfeffThis means that the script has had several changes to it to rework functionality.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b]-[/b]\xa0[size=3]The Reach is now its [b]own region[/b] separate from the \x201c\x63ool region\x201d. It is just slightly warmer.\n<br />\n<br />[b]-\xa0[/b]The warmth rating effectiveness is capped at 80% (matching SunHelm\x2019s cap)\n<br />\n<br />[b]-[/b]\xa0Seasons have been added. Each month has a multiplier tied to it, and will affect the temperature.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3][b]-[/b]\xa0The Cold widget will now only display when the ambient temp is at least chilly.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3][b]-\xa0[/b]Nords are now 15% resistant to the cold, and Khajiit are 10% resistant. (Down from 25% and 15%)\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3][b]-[/b]\xa0\x41rgonians' weakness to cold has been removed. It was unfair to have them be the only race with a racial debuff. There is even lore to back this decision up. (See \x201cOn Argonians\x201d, A book in ESO)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/6mZWOqO.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=4]Hunger[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[size=3][b]-[/b] Hunger rate, update interval, and stage values have been updated to provide a less annoying experience. You will become hungry much slower[/size]\n<br />   [size=3][b]\xfeff-[/b]\xa0Update Interval = 1hr\n<br />[/size]   [size=3]\xfeff[b]-[/b]\xa0Rate is 10pts/hour\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3][b]-[/b]\xa0\x45\x61ting now checks for \x201cVendorItemFoodRaw\x201d for raw food as well. (from Connor\x2019s survival mode)\n<br />\n<br />[b]-[/b]\xa0\x46ood restoration categories have been reworked with the following values[/size]\n<br />   [size=3][b]\xfeff-[/b]\xa0Very Small: 30 hunger\n<br />[/size]   [size=3][b]\xfeff-[/b]\xa0Small: 50 hunger\n<br />[/size]   [size=3][b]\xfeff-[/b]\xa0Medium: 80 hunger\n<br />[/size]   [size=3][b]\xfeff-[/b]\xa0Large: 150 Hunger[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/pk8ltrI.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=4]Fatigue[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[size=3][b]-[/b]\xa0\x41s with Cold and Hunger, rate, update interval, and stage values have been updated to be much slower among some other balance changes.[/size]\n<br />   [size=3][b]\xfeff-[/b]\xa0Update Interval = 1hr\n<br />[/size]   [size=3][b]\xfeff-[/b]\xa0Rate is 10pts/hour\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3][b]-\xa0[/b]Sleeping restores 30 Exhaustion per hour.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][b]-[size=3]\xa0[/size][/b][size=3]\x201c\x44rained\x201d is now called \x201cSlightly Tired\x201d.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b]-[/b]\xa0[size=3]Both Vampires and Werewolves can no longer get the Well Rested Bonus.\n<br />\n<br />- The player can now become\xa0\"Rested\" while sleeping in exterior areas.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/hzBPkqx.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=4][b]Vampires[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Vampires now receive increased resistances to hunger cold progression as detailed below:\n<br />[b]-[/b] Cold progresses 85% slower for vampires.\n<br />[b]-[/b] Vampires will no longer need to deal with hunger. Instead, the existing feeding mechanic already covers this.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=4]Misc[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]-\xa0[/b]The new diseases added by Survival Mode will no longer completely ignore disease resistance.\n<br />[b]-[/b] The carry weight penalty has been reduced by 50 points\n<br />[b]- [/b]The steed stone is no longer affected by Survival Mode.[/size]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=3][b]FAQ\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size][/color][size=3]Q: Is this coming to Xbox?\n<br />A: If I can find the time to upload, yes.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is this coming to PlayStation?\n<br />A: No unfortunately. It contains many script edits which are not allowed in PS4 modding. Therefore, it is impossible for me to upload this for PS4.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is X mod compatible?\n<br />A: Please see the compatibly section. If its not specified there or in the comments with other users then I likely don't have a good answer.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will I be adding a Thirst Mechanic?\n<br />A: For now, im not sure. I thought about it, but ultimately decided against it on release. There are a few reasons. I would have to do some heavy alterations to the ingestibles for this to line up. I would need to change to eating functionality, among other things. These changes would render many of the current Survival Mode patches for alchemy and other mods ineffective for this mod.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />A second reason is that currently each need for Survival Mode coincides with a player stat. That being your Magicka, Stamina, and Health. There is no stat to attach Thirst to. It would not show on the bars like the other needs would. In my opinion, it would simply feel out of place.\n<br />\n<br />Third reason, im not sure its [i]actually[/i] needed. I know what you are thinking, \"What do you mean its not needed??\". Well, Survival Mode sort of rolls in Thirst with Hunger. I think its best to keep it out of the mod. Its something that makes it unique from other needs mods, including my own.\n<br />[/size]"
