nexusDescription="[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Description[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Now that the following CC plugins are available as free DLC for the Special Edition, I thought I'd adress some issues I had with them.\n<br />\n<br />Many of the ingredients from [b]Rare Curios[/b] and [b]Saint and Seducers[/b] had some very strong effects, making them too powerful. I returned their values (magnitude and duration) back to Vanilla values. Optionally, I included a file which makes the effects slightly stronger than the Vanilla effects' values.\n<br />\n<br />Secondly, I changed the leveled lists of Welkynd and Varla stones, so they now are only available from the Khajiit vendors, but are no longer found randomly on illogical locations.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]FAQ[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you make a patch for X?\n<br />A: Maybe eventually, but not right now.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you port this to &lt;insert other version of Skyrim&gt;?\n<br />A: I only support the [color=#93c47d][b]PC Steam English Special Edition of Skyrim.[/b][/color] Any other version I won't support myself. However, I do allow others to port it to other version at their own responsibility. (see permissions)"
