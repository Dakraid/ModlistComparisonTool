nexusDescription="[size=4][u]Overview[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />So, I think we can all agree that the water in the blacksmith forge trough looks.. less than satisfactory. Static texture, hardly reflective, just not really nice looking at all&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod fixes that entirely. Every single forge in the game is now outfitted with fancy reflective, refractive, animated water&#33; This mod&#39;s original creator is [b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1008258/]rolloLG[/url][/b], he gave me permission to completely redo a good deal of the mod for compatibility reasons, ease of use, and of course, to work with Skyrim: SE.\r<br />\r<br />Plugin selection is pretty simple; if you use the Unofficial Patch, pick the USSEP version. If, for some reason you don&#39;t, pick the vanilla version. One or the other.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#a61c00][size=4][u]USSEP USERS READ THIS[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />So, the Nexus is currently doing something very strange, and won&#39;t let me upload the correct version of the .zip that contains the USSEP version. What happens instead is that it replaces it upon uploading with the non-USSEP version, and I have absolutely no idea why. You can grab the USSEP version here temporarily until I fix this:\xa0\r<br />[url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B14uGWMxVSqCbktXRFY3VTEzZjQ]https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B14uGWMxVSqCbktXRFY3VTEzZjQ[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u]Compatibility[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Should be compatible with any mod that doesn&#39;t edit forge location, or add new ones, including Open Cities Skyrim&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u]Misc[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />If you notice any weird seams or bugs with the water at any of the forges, let me know and I&#39;ll fix them up."
