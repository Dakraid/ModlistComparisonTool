DAR always intrigued me with all those special functions and what it could be achieved. Back then I couldn't do anything about it, but now you can have an immersive playthrough like none other before. Mods like\xa0[/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47670]Immersive interactions[/url][size=3],\xa0[/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34006]EVG conditional idles[/url]\xfeff\xa0[size=3]and so many other great animation mods brought much needed varierty to the game, and I thought I could expand on that ideas.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#e06666][size=2]Amazing video presentation by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/69400903]Mekafutoku[/url].

My goal is different. I focused on the little things. The things that surround the player moving around the world and the gameplay aspect from an animator's point of view. (I could never do what JaySerpa does :).)[/size]\n<br />[size=3]If you wanna play sneak characters for example, the same old vanilla animation is ok I guess, but what if I were to tell you that you can have different walking animations depending on how fast your moving, what are you current weapons equipped, how much injured you are? I can relate that it's just a game and my character can run and walk the same at 10% and at 100% health. Well... I say no more.\xa0[/size]\n<br />[size=3]I tried my best to achieve that and Underdog is presented and concieved as a whole. Meaning, that the animations for the most part depend on eachother, but they can be seperated if you wish so and\xa0[/size][i]replaced with your own favorite animation packs[/i][size=3]. Also, I made the animations having a modded game in mind because, to put it simply, it's 2021 and many wheels have allready been invented. Attack animations and effects of all kinds. Tools and frameworks that simply make the game a lot better and my animations are introduced into the game having maximum compatibilty in mind.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#ff7700][b][size=5]\xa0[/size][size=3][s]Controller is supported and encouraged!!![/s]\xa0Unfortunately Controller works quite differently than what I thought it would. Expect some animations (that have character speed requirements, like the crawl animation) not to play :/ Check the sticky post for a workaround provided by Simon73[/size][/b][/color]\xfeff[/center]\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/c2jAWpb.png[/img]\n<br />[b][size=6][u][color=#ff0000][center]CHECK WITHIN THE FOMOD FOR WHEN, WHY AND WHAT IS REQUIRED!!![/center][/color][/u][/size][/b]\n<br />\xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff\xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/Qzo3gZu.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700][center][/center][/color][/b][center][u][b]***I don't wanna flud the mod page with gifs (there are already too many in the front page if you ask me).

For example I wanted to dedicate a death for when dying from fall, but I couldn't wrap my head around what specific conditions happen then and only then. Eventually I went the simplest way, meaning no conditions, and hope for the best. On a bigger scale, if you do notice something extremely off, please post it and I ll try my best to refine the conditions.\xa0[/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/TLqkBPK.png[/img]\n<br />[b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3841389]tktk1[/url]\xa0\x66or the animation rig\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/19968244]Felisky384[/url]\xa0\x66or Dynamic Animation Replacer\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/10549885]DServant[/url]\xa0\x66or 360 Movement Behavior\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1492505]omega2008[/url]\xa0\x66or Scrolling Speed\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/126669]dDefinder1[/url]\xa0\x66or No Spinning Death Animation[/b]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/49752566]jokerline[/url]\xa0[b]for the amazing\xa0\x44isableTurnAnimation.dll[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />As always.\n<br />Enjoy!"
