nexusDescription="[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/1kX9UD0.png[/img][/center]   [center]   This mod replaces the model used for &#34;Homecooked Meals&#34; from the plain apple pie to something that looks more like a meal. Its appearance is based off of a [url=https://www.saveur.com/article/Travels/Icelandic-Seafood]real-life nordic meal[/url].\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s a plate of cooked chicken, dewy cherry tomatoes, frost mirriam, tender squash and new potatoes, all drowned in still-bubbling butter (a [i]true[/i] nord of Skyrim does not care for arterial health).\r<br />\r<br />It also adds a recipe for you to be able to cook it yourself (3 frost mirriams, 2 elves ears, 4 chicken breasts, 4 potatoes, 6 tomatoes, and a squash). Who says you can&#39;t cook your own homecooked meal?\r<br />\r<br />And in case you were wondering...I [i]would[/i] eat a stale apple pie that was found on the sidewalk.[/center]"
