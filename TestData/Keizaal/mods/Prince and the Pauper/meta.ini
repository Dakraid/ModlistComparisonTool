It is no wonder that Dagny is throwing a fit about getting a NEW dress! lol. \n<br />As a matter of fact, out of the 42 children featured in Skyrim, 27 are wearing OUTFIT01. Well, this mod changes that!

The new items can be purchased through the Khajiit traders and at the Pawned Prawn. The items available in their stock is randomly selected to be more realistic. (Hopefully.... if I did it right... hmmm.... guess we will see. *nervous laugh*) Well, I didn't want to make it simple! \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Details\n<br />=======\n<br />Has anyone else noticed that Dagny, the Jarl's daughter is wearing the same outfit as little orphan girl down by the Eldergleen? It is no wonder that Dagny is throwing a fit about getting a NEW dress! lol. As a matter of fact, out of the 42 children featured in Skyrim, 27 are wearing OUTFIT01. Well, this mod changes that! This allows the children to be dressed more realistically and with more variety.\xa0 \n<br />\n<br />Three Class:\n<br />Upper - Frothar, Dagny and Nelkir\n<br />Middle - Which includes most of the other children. Including the residents of Honorhall.\n<br /> Lower - Lucia, Sophie, Blaise and Alesan \n<br />\n<br />Of course, Dovahkiin can purchase clothing for his/her adopted children. \n<br />\n<br />Incompatibility\n<br />===============\n<br />Any mod that change or alters the children's \"clothing\" will most likely conflict.\xa0  Mods that simply add children should work just fine! \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Known Issues or Bugs\n<br />====================\n<br />\n<br />****ON THE FIRST RUN THE CHILDREN MAY BE IN THERE UNDIES! SAVE THE GAME. RELOAD. THE NEW CLOTHING WILL BE IN PLACE. AFTER THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO MORE ISSUES.****\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Install\n<br />=======\n<br />\n<br />Install using Nexus Mod Manager.

Children are wearing their shoes. *Accept Braith. Sometimes she has them on and sometimes she doesn't. I can't explain it. I do not plan to actively purse this particular issue for the time being. Just attributing it to Braith's personalilty. lol. \n<br />\n<br />2.0, 2013/11/16 - Complete mod overhaul.  \n<br />\n<br />Next on my agenda:  Telling Braith to put on her shoes! (lol. Picking on Braith but of course this glitch effects all children wearing that outfit type. So... Sorry, Braith it is time to put them on....)\n<br />\n<br />4.0, 2017/02/18 - Released to Special Edition.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />My Other Mods \n<br />============\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow]Pottery Recolors[/color]\n<br />  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/40736/?\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow]Prince and The Pauper SE[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow]Riften Specials[/color]\n<br />  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41594/?\n<br />  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=175557509\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow]Sate That Appetite[/color]\n<br />  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/45714/?\n<br />  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=189971791 (VANILLA Version)\n<br />  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=189823620 (RND Version)\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow]Sons of Skyrim Only SE[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow]Surile and Argonian Wine Recolor[/color]\n<br />  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41752/?\n<br />  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=176391418\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Contact\n<br />=======\n<br />\n<br />You can find me on Nexus or on Steam as 'JadeRoyale'\n<br />\n<br />Credits\n<br />=======\n<br />Thanks to Gamwich and Jacknifelee for allowing me to use their awesome textures.\n<br />Thanks to Popcorn71... for seeing what I could not and for not giving up on me.\n<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating The Elder Scrolls.\n<br />Thanks to Nexus.com for being there!\n<br />Thanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\n<br />\n<br />Tools Used\n<br />==========\n<br />7-Zip - http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=15579\n<br />GIMP - http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=14920\n<br />NIFSkope - http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/NifSkope\n<br />Readme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\n<br />TES5Edit \n<br />Creation Kit\n<br />\n<br />Licensing/Legal\n<br />===============\n<br />This mod contains many textures created by another mod author.
