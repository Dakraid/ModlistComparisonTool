So i made a little fix that would allow all the head to turn \n<br />black as well even if no helm is worn.\n<br />(I also add a craftable ebony mail without any enchantement at the forge, but since i want Ebony mail \n<br />to stay \"unique\", the craftable version has same amount of armor than \n<br />vanilla ebony armor.)\n<br />\n<br />Basically, it simply adds an alpha channel effect on the body when the armor enchantement activate, so we can see \n<br />through the eyes and the hair the black body under the normal body.\n<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />-The mod should not conflict with retexturing.\n<br />-The mod may conflict with mod altering the enchantement.\n<br />-The mod should work fine with mod editing the shader effect.\n<br />-The mod should also work with hair mod, but due to the way they are build, some hair style may not turn black completely.\n<br />(-You may have a \"useless\" craftable ebony mail at the forge if you use other\n<br /> mod to craft ebony mail that let the ebony mail keep the same stat than\n<br /> vanilla ebony mail, or it can simply conflict with since i didn't give a\n<br /> very special ID to the craftable ebony mail.)\n<br />\n<br />You will have to unequip and re equip the ebony mail, in order to update the effect, if \n<br />you load a savegame where you wear it after installing this mod.[/quote]"
