nexusDescription="[size=3]This mod attempts to fix any issues that exist with the Cloaks and Capes  mod. It also adds a few of my own tweaks that I find necessary.\n<br />\n<br />This mod requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2019]Cloaks and Capes[/url]\xfeff by volvaga0. It is only an edit of the esp, and does not include the cloak assets themselves.\n<br />This mod will also require a bashed patch, or another solution to resolve leveled list conflicts if you have them. (Just like any other mod that adds items to the game through leveled lists.)\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4][color=#9fc5e8]What has been fixed or changed?[/color][/size][size=3][color=#ffe599]\n<br />[color=#cfe2f3]\n<br />[color=#ffe599]&gt;[/color][/color][/color][color=#cfe2f3]This mod includes the Winterhold guards fix, as well as the Falkreath cloak keyword fixes from Cloaks and Capes Fixes. However, it does not include the tanning racks placed in the faction locations. This is due to the bullet point below..[/color][/size][size=3][color=#ffe599]\n<br />\n<br />&gt;[/color][color=#cfe2f3]Appropriate Faction cloaks are no longer tied to the location you are trying to craft them in. Instead, you will be able to craft them[/color]    \xfeff[color=#cfe2f3]   \xfeffonce you are a part of the corresponding faction. This effects the following cloaks:[/color][/size][size=3]\n<br />   \xfeff-Dawngaurd cloak[/size][size=3]\n<br />   \xfeff-College of Winterhold cloak[/size][size=3]\n<br />   \xfeff-Dark Brotherhood cloak[/size][size=3][color=#ffe599]\n<br />\n<br />&gt;[/color][color=#cfe2f3]Hold Guard cloaks are still tied to location to prevent menu clutter.[/color][/size][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffe599]&gt;[color=#cfe2f3]T[/color][/color][color=#cfe2f3]here have been several keyword changes.[/color][/size][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff-Removed helmet and cuirass keywords. These keywords do not belong on cloaks.[/size][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff-Only the fur cloaks had survival mode support keywords. Appropriate keywords have been added to the other cloaks.[/size][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff-Adjustments made to Frostfall Keywords (Most cloaks had the \"WeatherProofAccessory\" keyword. This keyword is only for    \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff\x61\x63\x63\x65ssories not cloaks, and was overwriting the chosen cloak keywords (Causing cloaks to not warm the player as effectively.)[/size][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffe599]&gt;[/color][color=#cfe2f3]All cloaks and capes now have a weight. Before, they did not weigh anything. [/color][/size][color=#cfe2f3]\n<br />[/color][size=3]\n<br />[color=#ffe599]&gt;[/color][color=#cfe2f3]Removed ingots from all of the fur cloak recipes, and added leather strips as instead.[/color][/size][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffe599]&gt;[/color][color=#cfe2f3]Most of the leveled list changes from the Cloaks and Capes  Distribution patch have been carried over to this mod. I have made some \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeffslight alterations to some of these.[/color][/size]"
