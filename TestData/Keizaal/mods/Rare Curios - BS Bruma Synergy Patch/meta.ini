nexusDescription="[center][color=#00ffff][b]What does this mod do?[/b][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />Uses the ingredients and Ayleid items introduced in Rare Curios to replace the equivalents found in Beyond Skyrim - Bruma. Also includes a new Varla Stone replacer based on the Rare Curios Flawed Varla Stone for consistency.\n<br />\n<br />Varla Stones are changed to act as refillable Greater Soul Gems, better than the flawed variants but not as strong as Azura's Star. An optional patch changes both types of Varla stone to act as single use consumables\n<br />\n<br />[b]Optional Patches:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][i]Consumable Varla Stones [/i]- Restores Beyond Skyrim - Bruma's Varla Stone functionality and gives Rare Curios' Flawed versions a weaker version. Varla stones are now single use items. This patch will likely require conflict resolution with mods that alter Flawed Varla Stone drop rates in Rare Curios.\n<br />[*][color=#ff0000][i]Consumable Varla Stones LOTD Patch[/i] - Allows the LOTD Rare Curios Patch to accept the altered Flawed Varla Stone (Not currently available)[/color]\n<br />[*][i]Consumable Varla Stones Cause Distribution[/i] - Distributes consumable Flawed Varla Stones (as a 25% chance drop) into the Ayleid \"special loot\" containers added alongside the Anniversary Update and used in The Cause. This is [i][b]not [/b][/i]compatible with the similar patch found on my The Cause - Rare Curios Patch page.\n<br />[*][i]Goblins Patch Consistency Patch[/i] - Resolves conflicts between this patch and my Bruma/Goblins patch for plantable items to continue to be plantable.\n<br />[/list]"
