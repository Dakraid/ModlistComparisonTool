nexusDescription="I made new scratch-made textures for Azura's Shrine a couple years ago for fun and practice but just realized they've been sitting on my hard drive collecting dust, so I decided to share them with y'all.\n<br />\n<br />New structural detail was added to the normal map and bakes, giving the face much more definition and detail and making Azura look a bit more like a Dunmer.\n<br />\n<br />These were hand-painted in Substance Painter.\n<br />\n<br />This is a straight texture replacer so just grab the 2K or 4K version (she big, so 4K isn't unwarranted here) and go!\n<br />\n<br />Enjoy!"
