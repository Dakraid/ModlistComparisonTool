nexusDescription="[font=Georgia][size=5][u]Overview:[/u][/size][/font][size=3]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />Adds a unique model and textures for the \"Quill of Gemination\" quest item. You retrieve this unique enchanted quill for Maven Black-Briar during the quest \"[url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Vald%27s_Debt]Vald's Debt[/url].\"\n<br />\n<br />The quill is supposedly able to duplicate any writing that the wielder is viewing, allowing for undetectable and flawless forgery. The quill was enchanted by the wizards at the College of Winterhold, who \"demanded a tremendous amount of gold to have it made.\" It requires a specially formulated ink to work. As such, the quill will now have a lavish red and gold appearance, befitting its status as a unique and costly item.\n<br />\n<br />Textures are provided in 2K or 4K resolution, in BC7 compression format. The included plugin is required to assign the item a unique mesh, as it previously used the standard quill assets. The plugin is an ESL-flagged ESP, so it will not take up a plugin slot in your load order. As only one record is edited, users may want to forward the change into another plugin (such as their personal bashed patch) in order to dispense with the extra .esp file.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][u][font=Georgia][size=5]Requirements:[/size][/font][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />None\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][u][font=Georgia][size=5]Installation:[/size][/font][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Download and install with a mod manager (Vortex or MO2). To use the optional 4K textures, download the main file first, and then overwrite it with the optional file.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][u][font=Georgia][size=5]Compatibility:[/size][/font][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Other mods that edit the record \"FVDQuill 'Quill of Gemination' [MISC:000C04BB]\" will conflict with this mod. Load \"Unique Quill of Gemination.esp\" after those mods to see the unique model.\n<br />Mods that replace the mesh and/or textures of the standard quill (eg. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659]SMIM[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32496]Rally's Quill and Inkwell[/url], etc.) are compatible.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][size=2][size=5][u][font=Georgia]Credits:[/font][/u][/size][/size][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to:\n<br />[url=https://sketchfab.com/E.Dejnes]E.Dejnes[/url] on Sketchfab for publishing their [url=https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/antique-book-with-quill-and-key-6be47f12c73342ef9232e29f71e0fa76]Antique Book with Quill and Key[/url] model under the [url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/]CC BY-NC 4.0[/url] license, from which I used some assets.\n<br />[url=https://www.sharetextures.com/]Sharetextures[/url] for their [url=https://www.sharetextures.com/textures/floor/decorative-ceramic-27/]Decorative Ceramic[/url] texture, released under the CC0 1.0 license.\n<br />Ritesh Man Tamrakar on Flickr for their [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/_rmt_/6092560022/]feather photo[/url], published under the [url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/]CC BY-SA 2.0[/url] license.\n<br />[url=https://www.blender.org/]The Blender Foundation[/url] for their amazing free 3D modelling program.\n<br />The [url=https://github.com/niftools/nifskope/releases]NifSkope[/url] Development Team for their invaluable tool.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/167469]ElminsterAU[/url] and the xEdit Team for the indispensable [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164]SSEEdit[/url].\n<br />The [url=https://www.gimp.org/]GIMP[/url] Development Team for their great open-source image editor.\n<br />[i]Bethesda[/i] for publishing [i]TES V: Skyrim[/i] and providing hours of enjoyment.\n<br />\n<br />(Also see Permissions and Credits tab for full attribution and credits.)\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][font=Georgia][u][size=4]Disclaimer:[/size][/u][/font]\n<br />[spoiler][size=3]This mod is not made, guaranteed, supported, or endorsed by Microsoft, Bethesda Game Studios, [size=3]Zenimax, [/size]or any of their affiliates.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]THE RESOURCES HEREIN ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW.
