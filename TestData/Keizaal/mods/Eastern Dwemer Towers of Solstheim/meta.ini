nexusDescription="This is a relatively simple mod that adds [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/190]Morrowind styled dwemer towers[/url] (retextured to match Solstheim's dwemer colour scheme) to the various ruins around Solstheim as well as bringing the exterior of Falbtharz up to the local design code.\n<br />\n<br />In replacing the assets outside Falbtharz, this mod also fixes a mismatched lift at its exit, which was previously Solstheim kit inside and skyrim kit outside.\n<br />\n<br />This package also contains various other external pieces of the resource with the updated textures applied, if you wish to use them. [i]No thanks is needed from me to use these, but please do ensure that you credit David Brasher and Enter_77 for the original work.\n<br />\n<br />[/i]This mod has been flagged as both an ESL and ESM to both save on your plugin count [i]and [/i]handle large references properly.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][center]Credits[/center][/b][/u]\n<br />David Brasher and Enter_77 for the original [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/190]Morrowind Dwemer Resources\n<br />[/url]UnimpressedPanda for the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22493]retextured dwemer door[/url] that I used to make the load door variant, but ultimately decided not to use. (This is included here for anyone else who might want to use it)"
