nexusDescription="This is a lighthearted mod that simply tweaks the generic idle dialogue that NPCs may utter, and implements custom animations to most of them (coughing, yawning and humming, but not sniffing or clearing throat). I made this for a bit of immersion, because for instance I started to think it's kinda rude how followers cough straight out while looking in the player character's general direction.\n<br />\n<br />The animations in this mod are technically not made from scratch, they are vanilla animations that I extracted from the base game and modified in other programs like hkxPoser.\n<br />\n<br />Another tweak I did to these \"dialogue lines\" was that I added more condition checks to them, to prevent them from being spoken while the actor is sleeping, swimming or sneaking.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Manual installation:[/u][/b]\n<br />Download the archive, open it in a Zip program of your choice then drag-and-drop the Data folder into your Skyrim SE directory (like\xa0[u]C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim Special Edition[/u] ), then you enable the plugin \"CAYWYH.esp\" in the SkyrimSE launcher or some mod manager of your choice.\n<br />Then you will have to re-generate your FNIS or Nemesis.\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]F76VgQ4BObo[/youtube]"
