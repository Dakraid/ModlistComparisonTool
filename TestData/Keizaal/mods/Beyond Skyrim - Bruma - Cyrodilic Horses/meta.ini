nexusDescription="This Mod replaces the bulky horses from Skyrim found throughout Bruma with horses more reminiscent of those found in Cyrodiil in the Third Era.\n<br />\n<br />There are five colors of horses:\n<br />- Paint Horses are common and can be bought from the stables in Bruma\n<br />- Bay Horses and Chestnut Horses are regualry seen in Service of the Imperial Legion\n<br />- Black Horses and White Horses are rare\n<br />\n<br />This Replacer can be installed at any time and only affects the horses in Cyrodiil, horses in Skyrim are unaltered, so it is compatible with other replacer mods for the vanilla horse. It also works with \"Convenient Horses\"."
