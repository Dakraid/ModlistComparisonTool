nexusDescription="So you're all excited by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861]Seasons of Skyrim[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63623]Turn of the Seasons[/url]and you spend hours and hours regenerating your LODs with Dyndolod and then you boot up the game and start a new one and......it starts on August 17th like [i]every single other time.[/i] So then you have to wait for months and months in-game to see your lovely snow.\n<br />\n<br />Well, it turns out this was already a solved problem! Ages ago, isoku released a lovely mod named [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1533]Holidays[/url] which gives you a brief window to change your start date at the beginning of the game (in addition to adding a bunch of holidays and other fun stuff). I contacted them and got the green-light to strip out everything except the start date options.\n<br />\n<br />So I basically took Holidays, yeeted approximately 96.734% of it, cleaned up the two scripts which were actually used to remove everything which wasn't needed (and also made Random just pick random, instead of having a series of cascading menus), renamed some stuff and cleaned some more stuff due to always requiring SKSE/SkyUI, and finally compacted and flagged as ESL.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Instructions[/i][/size]\n<br />Upon getting control of your character on a new game, you have until noon of your first day to change what your starting day is - just go into the MCM, and choose either Default Start Date (which you don't have to pick anyway), Manual Start Date (in which case the right column becomes available to edit and you can choose), or Random Start Date (which will randomly pick a date and time when you exit the menu)....and that's it. Once you're past noon, or have made a choice once, you're locked out from doing so again. Installing on an existing save which has already passed this threshold will be locked out from being able to make the choice, because some in-game triggers are based on time passed, so jumping around willy-nilly could break stuff.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Requirements[/i][/size]\n<br />[url=https://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE [/url]is assumed due to the fact that there's not really any [i]reason[/i] for this mod unless using Seasons of Skyrim....which requires SKSE. So I made it a hard requirement\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604]SkyUI[/url] is a hard requirement too just to keep everything simple.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Installation[/i][/size]\n<br />Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into your Skyrim data folder.\n<br />Translations for Czech, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, and Polish included. All of them but Polish are machine translated, so go nuts making your own.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Compatibility[/i][/size]\n<br />Should be compatible with anything, except I guess Holidays, but given the scripts were renamed you can [i]technically[/i] have both, even though it's pointless.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Credits[/i][/size]\n<br />[url=https://bethesda.net/]Bethesda[/url] for Skyrim Special Edition and the Creation Kit\n<br />ElminsterAU for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164]SSEEdit[/url]\n<br />isoku for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1533]Holidays[/url]\n<br />Czasior for the Polish translation - all the others are machine translated."
