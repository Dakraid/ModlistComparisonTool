nexusDescription="This is a relatively simple mod to replace the doors in Dawnstar with a unique variant that more closely matches the buildings added by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952]Cities of the North - Dawnstar[/url] and [s][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56731]Cities of the North - Falkreath[/url][/s] (now located on the Falkreath page) by JPSteel2. made using repurposed vanilla textures. Don't expect top of the line 8k textures here, but they are of at least vanilla quality.\n<br />\n<br />Also makes sure all load doors use the animated door variant, rather than static.\n<br />\n<br />If anybody wants to upscale the textures or make better textures, please do so, you don't need to ask permission."
