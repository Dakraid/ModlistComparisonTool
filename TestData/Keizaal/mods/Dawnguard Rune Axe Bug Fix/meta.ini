nexusDescription="[color=#6fa8dc][b]Description[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dawnguard_Rune_Axe]Dawnguard Rune Axe[/url] is a really cool axe with a some unique effects. (Camelworks even made [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsur5RJWZ94]a video[/url] about it.) Unfortunately, it has some issues, namely the following ones that I'm attempting to fix here:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] The undead counter doesn't always reset properly at 5 AM.\n<br />[*] Raising undead thralls yourself and killing them will also count as increasing the undead counter.\n<br />[*] At 100 kills, the Axe's enchantment will deal no damage. Getting another kill will set the damage to 100. \n<br />[*] Incorrect keywords/visual effects.\n<br />[*] Tempering the axe at a grindstone will make the counter to no longer reset.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />In this tweak, I attempt to fix all of these issues, by changing the following.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Removed the original script and used a new hidden quest to more accurately calculate the reset at 5 am part and make it still apply when being tempered.\n<br />[*] Added an option to make conjured undead no longer count. (see below how to customize that part.\n<br />[*] Instead of incrementing the damage by 10, per 10 undead killed, I changed to 1 extra damage each undead killed. The cap is still 100.\n<br />[*] Added proper keywords/visual effects, to reflect other sun damage effects.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />This mod uses an ESLified ESP (also called ESPFE), so I doesn't count towards the 255 ESP/ESM limit.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Customization[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />You can customize the 2nd point (so conjured undead still count) by using the following console command:\n<br />\n<br />[code]\n<br />set DGRuneAxe_RaisedUndeadAlsoCount to 1 (default is 0)\n<br />[/code]\n<br />\n<br />Setting this to 1 means raised undead will still count towards the counter. Any other value will mean they won't.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Requirements[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />- [url= https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266/]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch[/url]"
