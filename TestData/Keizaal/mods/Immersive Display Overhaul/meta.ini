If those fixes [i]were[/i] included in this mod they'd need to be forwarded where needed anyway. For best results, one should refer to the displays as they've been set up in USSEP.\n<br />\n<br />Mods that have extended the \"RackType\" property for additional types of displays will simply be shown an unfiltered Gift Menu instead of one that better matches what kinds of items it can accept. This can easily be improved upon if you contact me, or let me know here.[/size]"
