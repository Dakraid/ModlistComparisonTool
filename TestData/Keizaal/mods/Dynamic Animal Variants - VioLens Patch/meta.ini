nexusDescription="This mod makes animals spawn with different texture variants. \n<br />\n<br />Textures used were made by Bellyache, you can see what they look like in his mod page:\xa0https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3621\n<br />\n<br />For the mod to work it requires Real Rabbits HD by fadingsignal (it has to be the \"Diverse\" option not the \"Replacer\"!). The variants are applied through the script he created for his mod.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][b][size=4]Creatures and their variants[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Bear: Vanilla - Brown\n<br />Cave Bear : Vanilla - Black\n<br />Snow Bear: Vanilla - White\n<br />Chaurus: Brown - Green\n<br />Chaurus Reaper: Vanilla - Black - Red\n<br />Chicken: Vanilla - Barred - Bicolor - Black - Brown - Dark Brown - Specked - White\n<br />Dog: Vanilla - Black&amp;White - Brown - Brown&amp;White - Dark Brown - Dark Grey - Light Brown - White\n<br />Elk/Deer: Vanilla - Brown (younger look compared to vanilla)\n<br />Fox: Vanilla - Grey - Red - Silver\n<br />Arctic Fox: Vanilla - White\n<br />FrostBite Spider: Vanilla - Black - Brown - Dark Brown - Tan\n<br />FrostBite Spider Cold: Vanilla - Frost - Grey\n<br />Goat: Vanilla - Brown - Grey - White\n<br />Cow: Vanilla - Banded - Black - Brown - Orange - White\n<br />Painted Cow: Vanilla - Variant\n<br />Horker: Vanilla - Black - Brown - Grey - Light Brown - White\n<br />Mammoth: Vanilla - Brown - Grey - Light Brown - Light Grey - White\n<br />Mudcrab: Vanilla - Muddy - Oblivion - White\n<br />Sabrecat: Vanilla - Black - Brown Female - Brown Male - Stripped\n<br />Snow Sabrecat: Vanilla - Spotted - Stripped - White\n<br />Skeever: Vanilla - Brown - Brown Hooded - Dark Grey - Grey - Grey Hooded (for all the new textures the clean and mangy versions are used)\n<br />Venomfang Skeever: Vanilla - White\n<br />Wolf: Vanilla - Brown\n<br />Black Wolf: Vanilla - Blacker - Timber\n<br />Snow Wolf: Vanilla - Grey - Whiter\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f1c232][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Any retextures you use will still appear since all animals have a chance to use their vanilla skins.\n<br />\n<br />This mod changes some Race records and some NPC records for animals. Any mods that change the same records will have a conflict. I can make patches if needed just ask in the comments and when i have the time i will check it out. Anyone that wants to make a patch can do so too.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][b][size=4]Install / Uninstall[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Can be installed at any time. Load this mod after Real Rabbits HD - Diverse.\n<br />\n<br />Should be able to be uninstalled at any time. Just make sure to be somewhere with none of the affected animals (like a player house) and use clean save procedures.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f1c232][size=4]Credits / Permissions[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />All credits go to Bellyache (wrig675) and fadingsignal. Without their mods this one wouldnt exist, i just did the grunt work.\n<br />\n<br />All permissions from Bellyache's mod applies to this one\n<br />\n<br />This mod doesn't include any assets from fadingsignal's mod, it only includes references to his script. Be aware of this If you modify or patch my mod."
