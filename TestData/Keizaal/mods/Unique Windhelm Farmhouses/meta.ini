nexusDescription="Makes the Farmhouses near windhelm use Kraeten's stormcloak cabin. Interiors and navmeshes have been redone to match but you'll need to regenerate the LOD. I haven't esl flagged it as it makes updating it more annoying, but it's been compressed so you can without fear of breaking your game.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />You need to start a new game as I moved the doors a few feet\n<br />\n<br />If you like this, please endorse it as I reckon that helps people find it"
