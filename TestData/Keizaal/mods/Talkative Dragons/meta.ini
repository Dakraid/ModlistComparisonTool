nexusDescription="[size=4][color=#62a0d4]Overview[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />This mod reuses some vanilla voice lines to make dragons speak during combat, so they feel like sentient creatures instead of just mere beasts. I recently started a new game and was surprised that Mirmulnir actually said something during the fight, because I didn\x2019t remember that at all from my other playthrough. And most of those lines aren\x2019t anything special either, just generic combat talk. I can see where the devs were trying to go with making quest related dragons more unique by adding dialogue, but in the end, you fight those few dragons once (or not at all if you choose not to do the main quest), and all the rest you battle on a daily basis are silent. There are mods that enable voice lines for shouting, but I haven\x2019t seen anything that adds dialogue.\n<br />\n<br />There are a few completely generic lines that will be used regardless of the dragon\x2019s target, and some additional ones that refer to the Dovahkiin \x2013 those will be used alongside the generic ones when the dragon is targeting the player, and you\x2019ve spoken to the Greybeards (MQ105).\n<br />\n<br />Paarthurnax, Alduin and Odahviing have unique voices, so they won\x2019t use those lines. You\x2019re not going to see the first two in combat outside quests anyway (unless you have mods that spawn enemies such as SOT and they happen to spawn someone on the Throat of The World, but that is very rare, and I don\x2019t think Paarthurnax has combat lines that don\x2019t refer to Alduin). Odahviing doesn\x2019t have generic combat lines that don\x2019t refer to the player or shouting, so I only added the shouting ones and they\x2019ll be used if he\x2019s targeting another dragon. I set the chance for it relatively low so it\x2019s not too repetitive.\n<br />\n<br />A few more details about the lines:\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[list]\n<br />\x25d8 If you happen to kill dragons after Mirmulnir\x2019s death but before speaking to the Greybeards, they\x2019ll have that surprised death cry \x201c\x44ovahkiin? No!!\x201d that Mirmulnir uses when he somehow senses who you are. Unfortunately that is the only death line I found, so after you talk to the Greybeards dragons won\x2019t say anything while dying.\x25d8 There\x2019s a 50% chance that the dragons will express their disgust if you\x2019re dishonourable and use Dragonrend on them.\x25d8 All the other lines have an equal 20% chance to be played. This is because dragon battles can get a bit lengthy, especially with dragon and combat overhaul mods, and having them constantly talking would get old real quick. They will still talk often enough so you won\x2019t have a silent battle unless it only takes a few seconds.[/list]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#62a0d4]Other Versions[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/99157/]LE[/url] \x2013 ported by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/29766055]FierySnowman[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/8755001]EmeraldShadow[/url]\n<br />Thanks!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#62a0d4]Video Previews[/color][/size] \x2013 made by [url=https://old.reddit.com/user/ShenziSixaxis]ShenziSixaxis[/url] and [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/4574724-hodegar/]hodegar[/url] \x2013 thank you so much!\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]JdWvgmhmZEY[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]Vn40w2Rjvwo[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#62a0d4]Manual Installation[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Unpack the archive into your Skyrim Special Edition&#92;Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#62a0d4]Compatibility[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />I only overwrote one record ([i]CreatureDialogueDragon[/i]), which has minimal use, so it should be compatible with anything. Dragons added by mods (e.g. Diverse Dragons, Deadly Dragons etc.) will also speak as long as they use vanilla \x201c\x43rDragonVoice\x201d (which I\x2019m fairly sure all dragons with no custom voice lines use).\n<br />\n<br />To clarify, if you want to ask \x201cWill this be compatible with X?\x201d, the answer is yes, I\x2019m 90% sure about that. If you have mods with dragons with custom voices, they won\x2019t use dialogue lines from my mod, but they won\x2019t prevent dragons with\xa0\x201c\x43rDragonVoice\x201d from using them.\n<br />If you\x2019re wondering what I changed, I modified the condition in\xa0[i]CreatureDialogueDragon [/i]to check for a list of dragon voices instead of just\xa0\x201c\x43rDragonVoice\x201d in order to enable lines for Odahviing (his voice is\xa0\x201c\x43rUniqueOdahviing\x201d so the old condition checking for\xa0\x201c\x43rDragonVoice\x201d would always return false). Other records in my mod don\x2019t overwrite anything, they only refer to the\xa0[i]CreatureDialogueDragon[/i] quest.\n<br />\n<br />It\x2019s probably worth mentioning that my mod is flagged as ESL, which means it won\x2019t contribute to the plugin limit of 255.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#62a0d4]My Other Mods[/color][/size]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37092]Simple Storage Management[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28612]Cathedral Weathers \x2013 Diverse Seasons[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28269/]Greybeard Meditation[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28028]Dragon Soul Absorpton for NPC[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25454]Odahviing Improved[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24827]Ash Pile \x2013 Texture Replacement[/url] \n<br />[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24812]Combat Fixes for Flying Mod Beta[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24255]Clean and Improved Mage Robes[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23460]Dispel Magic Effects[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23179]Better Blessing of Akatosh[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22763]Dragon Aspect \x2013 Mage Version[/url]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[/size]"
