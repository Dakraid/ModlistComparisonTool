nexusDescription=This mod is heavily inspired by Honored Dead for Skyrim LE.\n<br />\n<br />I felt as though the mods for SE that tried to do something similar either had a few glaring issues or ended up reducing immersion. This simple mod places past battlefields around Skyrim as well as Imperial prisoners outside of Windhelm and a Stormcloak prisoner outside of Solitude.\n<br />\n<br />This mod contains:\n<br />\n<br />Ambushed Imperial Convoy on the Road East of Helgen\n<br />\n<br />An Imperial Checkpoint Going to Markarth\n<br />\n<br />A Large Battle in the Forest of The Pale\n<br />\n<br />Thalmor and Imperials vs. Stormcloak Soldiers in the Marshes\n<br />\n<br />Shipwrecked Imperial and Stormcloak Fleet between Winterhold and Dawnstar\n<br />\n<br />An Imperial Checkpoint near Fort Greymoor\n<br />\n<br />Buried Stormcloak Soldiers near Windhelm\n<br />\n<br />Two Imperial Prisoners near Windhelm\n<br />\n<br />One Stormcloak Prisoner near Solitude
