The East Empire Company signage. Unless you spend a fair amount of time at the Solitude docks, you probably haven&#39;t given much thought (or care) to the appearance of the East Empire Company signage, but it always seemed rather poorly done to me. This is supposedly the richest company in all of Skyrim, but any tavern or shop has a nicer sign out front than the East Empire Company does. The crate signs were just too low resolution to be legible. The signage looked very slapdash and indistinct.\r<br />\r<br />So, I decided to give the East Empire Company signage a face lift and make it a bit more detailed and legible in game. That&#39;s it really, two sets of textures... one 2k set for the large carved sign, and one 1K set for the painted crate sign.\r<br />\r<br />For installation, the file path is Data &gt; textures &gt; architecture &gt; solitude.\r<br />\r<br />Cheers,\r<br />Gamwich\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE: Version 1.1 makes the size of the painted ship on the crates smaller, so it doesn&#39;t get cut off on some of the crates. It also adds a dark version for people who have light colored crates that didn&#39;t display the white painted ship graphic well. You now have a choice, depending on your\xa0preferred\xa0\x63ratewood textures.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][center][youtube]HF62PCynjIc[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://s150.photobucket.com/user/Blue-Bolt/media/Skyrim/Rustic_East_Empire_Signage_front02.jpg.html][img]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s86/Blue-Bolt/Skyrim/Rustic_East_Empire_Signage_front02.jpg~original[/img]\r<br />[/url]\r<br />[url=http://s150.photobucket.com/user/Blue-Bolt/media/Skyrim/Rustic_East_Empire_Signage_front03.jpg.html][img]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s86/Blue-Bolt/Skyrim/Rustic_East_Empire_Signage_front03.jpg~original[/img][/url]"
