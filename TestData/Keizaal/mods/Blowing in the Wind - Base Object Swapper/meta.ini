nexusDescription="A very simple mod utilising the meshes made by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/354618]sialivi[/url]\xa0\x66or their classic mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5124]Blowing in the Wind SSE[/url]. I made this mod because I like my Skyrim vanilla and compatible, and I feel newer sign and lanterns mods do too much and are annoying to manage in larger load orders.\n<br />\n<br />The classic mod Blowing in the Wind makes ALL (store and inn) signs in the game moveable. The [u]signs[/u] are made moveable by simply editing the mesh files. The original mod also makes hanging vanilla [u]lanterns[/u] moveable by replacing the respective references in the game world with the moveable lantern meshes inside of an .esp file. This means that any mod adding new (vanilla) lanterns would need to be manually patched.\n<br />\n<br />My mod as an attempt to make all patches obsolete by using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805]Base Object Swapper[/url] to change the base object of the lantern. Any new mod (like Bruma, or Wyrmstooth, or any house mods you download) adding vanilla lanterns should immediately make use of the moveable mesh by sialivi, without the need for patching. By using Base Object Swapper world space edits are reduced to 0.\n<br />\n<br />[b]What you need (to do):[/b]\n<br />- Download and install\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805]Base Object Swapper[/url]\n<br />- Download and install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5124]Blowing in the Wind SSE[/url]\xa0\x61nd during installation disable any patches. The whole reason for my mod is that patches are redundant ;)\xa0\x44uring the install,\xa0pick your own preffered weight settings and the mesh models you want to use. Personally I use signs with the recommend weight and the SMIM lantern model with the recommended weight.\xa0[i]NOTE: the 'mixed models lanterns' option will not give any result in the game; my mod will always only utilise the mesh that is under sialivi&#92;movablelantern01a.nif. Using mixed models is outside of the scope of this mod.\xa0\n<br />[/i]- Download and install my mod and make sure that my .esp overwrites the original .esp form Blowing in the Wind.\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />[b]Here is what my mod does:[/b]\n<br />- Removed ALL entries from the Blowing in the Wind SSE.esp except one moveable static which links to\xa0sialivi&#92;movablelantern01a.nif. In other words, the new .esp you will be using consists of literally [b]1 record[/b]. I also removed all world space edits to the signs that were done in the original mod; they were unneeded and highly subjective and made things less compatible. By removing all world space edits there are no compatibility issues whatsoever with other mods.\n<br />- Flagged my version of\xa0\x42lowing in the Wind SSE.esp as esl, saving you a plugin slot.\n<br />- Added the file\xa0\x42lowing in the Wind SSE_SWAP.ini which is used by Base Object Swapper to swap out the static vanilla lantern (0x02D847) for the moveable lantern mesh (0x000800)\xa0\x63reated by sialivi. That .ini looks like this:\n<br />[quote]\xfeff[Forms]\n<br />;MoveableLantern01a\n<br />0x02D847~Skyrim.esm|0x000800~Blowing in the Wind SSE.esp[/quote]\n<br />- To reiterate: my mod does not contain the original meshes made by sialivi, so you need to download the original mod. I'm trying to get their permissions to include the meshes in my mod so it's completely standalone, but I have not been able to get in contact with them.\n<br />- If you only want to use my mod for the lanterns and not the signs, simply delete the signs from the original Blowing in the Wind mod (the signs are only meshes and textures). Just make sure to keep\xa0sialivi&#92;movablelantern01a.nif and its texture, because that is the lantern mesh.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Bugs:[/b]\n<br />- My mod makes literally ALL lanterns with candles moveable, also those placed on tables or placed on the floor. In theory, those kind of lanterns are also replaced with 'hanging' lanterns. This means that factually the new lanterns are 'hanging' on the table, and when they collide with something (bow attack, shout) they make the same swinging motion as the hanging lanterns. You can test this by\xa0\x65ntering\xa0[i]COC huntershack[/i]\xa0in the console and removing the table that is supporting the lantern and then hitting the latern. In practice, though, I've yet to encounter a situation where a lantern was placed too far from an underground to actually be able to start the 'swinging' movement (except for the hanging lanterns, obviously). However, Skyrim is a big game and there might be instances where Bethesda placed lanterns too far from any underground. Please let me know any egregious offenders and I'll take a look.\xa0\n<br />- If for some reason I'm missing something very obvious that causes bugs, also let me know please."
