It lies a stone's-throw from the most opulent city in Skyrim and in the shadow of one of the province's oldest structures, yet the town itself is\xa0nothing more than a collection of thatch-roofed huts. Other modders have made great attempts at remaking Dragon Bridge, but none of those fit quite what I wanted. In my mind, Dragon Bridge is a wealthy hamlet by Skyrim's standards, steeped in Haafingar's uniquely cosmopolitan variety of Nordic culture, yet still exhibiting a rustic flair. As such, it was the architecture itself which needed to change.\n<br />\n<br />[b]What this is[/b]\n<br />Rodryk's Dragon Bridge replaces the structures in Dragon Bridge with unique new architecture models created by me, modeled in a Solitude-inspired rustic style. Each building has had its interior and exterior remade in detail to match my vision of the town. Additionally, there are a few extras, such as a custom signpost on the road to Solitude, which make the town's exterior feel a bit more unique without going overboard. Everything is fully navmeshed, and I've ensured full functionality of all standard events (Dragon attacks, playing hide-and-seek, etc). You also might find some new literature scattered around...\n<br />\n<br />[b]What this isn't[/b]\n<br />Rodryk's Dragon Bridge does [b]not[/b] add new buildings or NPCs which didn't exist in the vanilla game, nor does it contain a player home. The goal I had in mind while creating this was essentially to make the vanilla town better, not to expand it. That said, my permissions are open and anyone may use my assets to add their own player homes or other extras.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/uY5UVKz.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />Basic installation is the same as any other mod (drop in your data folder and activate the plugin), however there are a few extra steps. \n<br />First, for the parallax version to work properly you must have [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31963]SSE Parallax Shader Fix[/url]\xfeff\xfeff installed.\n<br />Second, you will need to run DynDOLOD for the new architecture to be visible from a distance.\n<br />\n<br />Finally, I've moved certain objects marked as \"Persistant\", which means that if you've already been to Dragon Bridge on your current save, some things may be out of place. A new game is recommended for that reason.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/1MMH9Jc.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Generally speaking, Rodryk's Dragon Bridge will [u][b]not[/b][/u] be compatible out-of-the-box with mods which place things near buildings in Dragon Bridge. Most of those will require a patch to avoid floating meshes or other weirdness. I've already created a few patches for my own load order, with more on the way. If you have created a patch, let me know through a PM and I'll link it here.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Patches\n<br />[/b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424]ELFX[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[i]-Patch found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43032/]here[/url]\xfeff-\n<br />[/i]Provided by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/777131]RedBag[/url]\xfeff.\xa0\x44isables ELFX changes to Dragon Bridge interiors.\n<br />-\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424/]ELFX - Exterior[/url]\n<br />[i]-Found in\xa0[i]Misc\xa0[/i]Files-[/i]\n<br />Provided by\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/41087065]TheHessiJames[/url]\xfeff.
