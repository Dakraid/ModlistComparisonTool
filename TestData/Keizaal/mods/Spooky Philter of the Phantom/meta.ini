nexusDescription="When you investigate the haunted Shroud Hearth Barrow in Ivarstead, you can find a potion called Philter of the Phantom. This potion originally didn't do anything except make you look like a ghost, but with this mod you can now use it to scare civilians! You can even play a prank on Wilhelm before showing him Wyndelius' journal.\n<br />\n<br />The effect doesn't scare current or former followers, the undead, people who are too brave, or people who are trained in Illusion."
