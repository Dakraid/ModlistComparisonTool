nexusDescription="This is the latest project I worked on.\n<br />\n<br />These animations are intented to be used with a shield/unarmed combination. I have a vision to make a Captain America fighting style ingame and this is what I was able to come up with so far. So far, because the animation scene is changing and there will be more things to consider regarding the techicalities of animations (fingers crossed for thrown shield animations).\n<br />\n<br />So without further ado I present to you the shield animation makeover.\n<br />\n<br />The set cosists of new shield idle, 2 block shield idles, 3 regular bashes, 1 power bash and 1 new right hand (knee) attack animation. The new attack is included in the optional Unarmed attack animations. I ve allready made a power attack too but can't make it work right atm - looks awesome though so I m not giving up on it yet. If you want cool power attacks check the recommended mods section.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The optional section : contains unarmed attacks fitting (to my taste ofc), the unarmed/shield playstyle. These are drawn from my unarmed animations.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[i][center]ALL OPTIONS AND ALL OF MY MODS CAN BE INSTALLED TOGETHER. ANY CONFLICTS CAN BE INGNORED.[/center][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Regarding the DAR conditions :[/b] I 've set it up to affect only the player character and to play when you have a shield and empty right hand equipped.\n<br /> A seperate download for when holding any other one handed weapon is provided in the misc section of downloads, but [b]the unarmed/shield combo is the intention here[/b], so while the animations work for other onehanded/shield combinations, the right hand is adjusted to NOT hold a weapon, you might have other animations overwritting mine, or mixed played, especially when there is a random factor. Without the random factor, whichever animation wins, will be played. With a random factor each animation gets a chance to be played. Check with your set up and make the appropriate adjustions if needed.\n<br />[b]Even more clarifications on DAR functions :[/b] the animations have the name of the hkx file to dictate [u]what[/u] they will replace. It's the DAR conditions that dictate [u]when[/u] they will replace - under which conditions.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00]Recommended mods :[/color]\n<br />If you want different and more awesome power attacks have a look at this [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40698]Unarmed 4-directional Power attacks[/url]. Just change the name of the animations to\xa0h2h_attackpowerforwardrighthand.HKX.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00]Incompatibilities :\n<br />[/color]Having\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37804]Extra Drawing Animations[/url], produced a bug where the upper body of the character would T - pose after shield unequip.\n<br />\n<br />Check the media section for more visual info on the animations. If the gif file isn't enough I could make a video I guess. Just don't expect a Heavy Burns quality.\n<br />\n<br />I hope you like them.\n<br />Enjoy!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />My other mods :\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50634]Unarmed Street Fighter SkySa[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50299]Shield animations (Captain America)[/url]\n<br />[color=#ff00ff][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49072]THOR Mace idle Animation DAR[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48966]Dagger Unequip Animation DAR[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49285]Right Sneak attack variations DAR\n<br />[/url][/color][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48932]Flying Sprint Animation DAR[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/107606]\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49660]Unarmed Fighter - Animations[/url]"
