nexusDescription="[quote][i]\xfeff[/i][i][color=#00ff00]His ancient name was the Udyrfrykte, though the settlers knew him only as death.[/color]\xa0\n<br />The Udyrfrykte came to the newly completed mead hall and wreaked vengeance upon those who had shattered the peace of his long, cold sleep. He killed without warning, without mercy, reducing the Thirsk Nords to half their number.[/i]\n<br />-Thirsk, a History[/quote]\n<br />The monster dwelling within the Dawnstar Sanctuary has a long and terrible family history. Its brother slaughtered half the residents of Thirsk Mead Hall before being magically sealed in an icy cavern. A century passed and the entrance thawed. The beast attacked again, leaving only one survivor (TES3: Bloodmoon DLC). Years later, that survivor would attempt to hunt down the monster's mother, only to be devoured alongside her husband (TES4). \n<br />\n<br />Now, another 200 years have passed. The Dark Brotherhood has unsealed the Dawnstar Sanctuary to discover another monstrosity that has burrowed its way inside.\n<br />\n<br />But wait...it's just a lopsided,\xa0pinkish-brown troll? What happened to the baboon-like face? The four tusks? The thick black coat? The glowing green eyes and skin? What happened to the many resistances described in in-game books? And you no longer get any unique loot from it?\xa0\xa0\n<br />Disappointing.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][size=4]This mod restores Udefrykte to the glory of its predecessors in TES3 and TES4:[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#93c42d]Unique Model[/color][/b]\n<br />Udefrykte is still recognizable as a troll, but now it's also visually unique and consistent with its brother in Bloodmoon.[list]\n<br />[*]Longer snout similar to a baboon\n<br />[*]Four tusks\n<br />[*]Glowing green eyes and skin\n<br />[*]Black fur\n<br />[*]4 fingers and toes, elongated forward-pointing feet\n<br />[*]etc\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Features in the optional plugin:[/b]\n<br />[b][color=#93c42d]Formidable Foe[/color][/b]\n<br />Udefrykte now resists most forms of damage, as in previous games (and explicitly stated in 2 different in-game books), and balanced for TES5.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Resistant to weapons; susceptible to Silver weapon damage\n<br />[*]Resistant or immune to most magical damage; susceptible to fire\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][color=#93c42d]Lootable Trophy[/color][/b]\n<br />In TES3 you were asked to retrieve the beast's heart as proof of its death. The heart is then displayed in Thirsk Mead Hall as evidence of your valor, a tradition historically honored among the Thirsk. Now that tradition lives on: After completing either\xa0[i]Retaking Thirsk[/i] or\xa0[i]The Chief of Thirsk Hall[/i], you can display Udefrykte's heart in Thirsk once again. (Or you can keep it, Skyrim's a free country.)\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/1704/6123863-1640671321.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][size=4]FAQs[/size][/color] [spoiler]\n<br />[color=#93c42d]Does this make Udy stronger?[/color]\xa0It gives extra resistances to be consistent with the older games, which will make the battle more difficult, but it doesn't directly buff its stats or anything since that would be outside of the scope of this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c42d]Wasn't Udyrfrykte susceptible to Daedric weapons in TES3?[/color]\xa0In Bloodmoon, ghosts had the ability \"Resist Normal Weapons\". In Skyrim, ghosts have the ability \"Resist Damage\" combined with bonus damage from Silver. Udyrfrykte had that same Resist Normal Weapons ability as ghosts in Morrowind, and now Udefrykte has the same Resist Damage + Silver susceptibility as ghosts in Skyrim. This way it is consistent with the changes to game mechanics that happened between TES3 and TES5, and avoids creating huge combat mechanic edits that would conflict with every other combat mod. But if you install another mod to add Daedric-susceptibility to ghosts to fix that inconsistency with TES3, it would probably not need any patch to apply to my Udefrykte. :)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c42d]TES3's Udyrfrykte was holding a nord leg, why isn't this one?[/color]\xa0\n<br />1. I don't think Bloodmoon's Udy planned to hold onto that nord leg forever. It had only been holding it for a very short time, since he just finished killing the leg's owner, so 200 years later we wouldn't expect him to still be holding it.\n<br />2. This isn't the same Udy. Even if the original (now deceased) Udy planned to hold onto that nord leg for 200 years, that doesn't somehow cause his brother to be holding a nord leg too.\n<br />3. Skyrim's Udy is still trapped in an ice cave. He doesn't have access to any nords from whom to obtain legs.\n<br />4. Mechanically, trolls can't wield weapons in Skyrim. Just gluing it into the troll's hand would look funny without proper animations etc.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][size=4]Technical[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#93c42d]Install:[/color][/b]\xa0Use a mod manager to choose your install options.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#93c42d]Uninstall:[/color][/b] Completely safe if you don't use the plugin. If you did use the optional plugin, you should clean your save (but it's still [i]relatively[/i] safe if you don't).\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#93c42d]Compatiblity:[/color][/b] Universally compatible if you don't use the plugin. If you do use the optional plugin, you might require patches for mods that edit Udefrykte or the interior of Thirsk Mead Hall. Other mods that add Udefrykte spawns [i]should[/i] use the new model out of the box, and hopefully the plugin changes too, depending on how they implemented it.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#93c42d]ESL flagged?[/color][/b] Yes, the ESP is ESL-flagged to not use a plugin slot.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][size=4]Credits[/size][/color]\n<br />Thanks to Kajaun for allowing me to modify and use his [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68131/?]TROLL[/url] texture!
