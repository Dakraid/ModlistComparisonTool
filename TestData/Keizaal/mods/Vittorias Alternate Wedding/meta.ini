nexusDescription="[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Introduction[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />I have been thinking of making a mod like this for quite a while, but a [url=https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/re9fw3/i_wish_i_could_attend_vittoria_vicis_wedding/]recent request[/url] on Reddit convinced me to work on this.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]What this mod does[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />If you finished the quest [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Destroy_the_Dark_Brotherhood!]Destroy the Dark Brotherhood[/url] AND you have visited Solitude at least once (have Roggvir's execution scene play out fully), it will take about 2 days for a courier to arrive with an invitation to the Vittoria's wedding. When you read the invitation, the quest will start.\n<br />\n<br />Then you can go to Solitude, attend the wedding, talk to the guests and newly weds and listen to Vittoria's speech.\n<br />\n<br />In addition, there was this [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Aquillius_Aeresius]weird man[/url] at Vittoria's house that used the same bed as her, despite not being mentioned anywhere or related, so I gave him another bed.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Rewards[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Disposition of Vittoria and Asgeir will be raised to rank 1.\n<br />[*] The merchant inventory of Vittoria will have some additional rare items added to it.\n<br />[*] Optionally: one perk point. (You need to load the optional file after the main file, if you want this.)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod might be conflict with mods that edit Vittoria Vici's house, or that edit the same lines. In case of the latter, some dialogue lines might reappear that may no longer be true. (for instance, Vittoria mentioning she needs to plan her wedding, after the wedding has already happened.)\n<br />\n<br />Known conflicts: (thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/62963186]wowfr [/url]for poiting these out)\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654]AI Overhaul[/url] Packages are not forwarded for Aquillius (very quick to do, just drag [i]AIOFleeList[/i] and [i]AIOSWorkDocks8x12[/i] in SSEEdit and keep the sleep package from this mod not the one from AI Overhaul)\n<br />[*]Must be loaded AFTER\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22075]Guard Dialogue Overhaul[/url]\n<br />[*]Must be loaded AFTER\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18330]Immersive World Encounter[/url]\n<br />[*]Must be loaded AFTER\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187]Relationship dialogue overhaul[/url]\n<br />[*]Must be loaded BEFORE [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424]ELFX Enhancer[/url]\n<br />[*]Must be loaded AFTER [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704]At Your Own Pace[/url]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Requirements[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]FAQ[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is this compatible on a existing save?\n<br />A: It should work yes, if you destroyed the Dark Brotherhood already.\n<br />\n<br />Q: What about [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Salonia_Carvain]Salonia[/url] and [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Plautis_Carvain]Plautis Carvain[/url]? Will they attend the wedding?\n<br />A: They actually have another radiant quest called \"Lost after the wedding\". So they'll still be wandering Skyrim afterwards. Having them actually attend the wedding would require more dialogue splicing and properly integrating them in the quest. Maybe in the future, but at this point, I have no plans to do so.\n<br />\n<br />Q: How about player marriage to Vittoria Vici?\n<br />A: I have no current plans for that.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Where will Asgeir stay after the wedding?\n<br />A: He will live in Vittoria's house in Solitude. I even gave him some new AI packages in Solitude. He will also work at the East Empire Company.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Can you make &lt;insert person&gt; attend the wedding?\n<br />A: That would require major rewrites in the quest, as well as splicing suitable lines together. Maybe in the future, but not for now.\n<br />\n<br />Q: ESPFE?\n<br />A: Yes.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you make a patch for X?\n<br />A: Maybe eventually, but not right now.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you port this to &lt;insert other version of Skyrim&gt;?\n<br />A: I only support the [color=#93c47d][b]PC Steam English Special Edition of Skyrim.[/b][/color] Any other version I won't support myself. However, I do allow others to\n<br /> port it to other version at their own responsibility. (see permissions)\n<br />\n<br />Q: I have this cool idea. &lt;insert idea&gt; Will you add this?\n<br />A: Maybe. If I like it and doesn't take too much time/effort.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Does this work with AE?\n<br />A: Maybe, I don't know. I myself use the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57618?]\"best of both worlds version of the downgrade patcher\"[/url]."
