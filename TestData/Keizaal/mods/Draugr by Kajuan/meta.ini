I started to work on vanilla files (with the High Texture Pack installed) that were 2k (512 the hair). This mod doesn't take any slot in your load order.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]For references the files were taken here:\n<br />textures&#92;actors&#92;draugr (12 file)\n<br />textures&#92;actors&#92;dlc02&#92;hulkingdraugr (4 file)\n<br />textures&#92;dlc01&#92;clutter&#92;vampireremains (1 file)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]I tried more to improve then to change. The skins have been revisited, it should appear more slimy. Many things have been redone, the teeth, ears, lips. Still that the vanilla draugr meshes are really cornered, clips one with another, stretching, there is nothing that can be done about in my opinion, if not to create new meshes.\n<br />The Draugr armors (Ancient Nord, both female and male) in the same draugr folder, have been worked too, they appear now more rugged, the fur and pelt inserts have been redone too.

The ancient \n<br />north armor that the player can wear [size=3]it is[/size] in another folder, behind all the armors of the game, and it was not included. The female veil, contained in the same female Draugr skin file, has been enhanced, within the skin itself of course, the fabric should appear more detailed now.[/size] [size=3][size=3]Hair and their color have been changed as well, the male version is whitish now, the female one more dark.[/size][/size][u]\n<br />[/u]\n<br />To let you know, glowing eyes effect have separated meshes and textures, I could adjust the textures, but really they were not visible in the game, so I left them alone, also because the glowing eyes are essentially made by the meshes and some light setting over them, that can be easily changed by editing the mesh. Texture are completely secondary in this case.\xa0 The small dot you see in the living Draugr males it is attached to each body male mesh. The female doesn't use it, I still wonder why the authors made it for male, although the female show the same light effect when awake. \n<br />\n<br />Edit: Added two files in miscellaneous section.\n<br />The first remove the ugly 3d pupil on Draugr meshes (female and Hulking Draugr don't use it). \n<br />The second greatly reduced the Eyes light effect on male and slight reduce it on female. Enough to not seem bottle caps.\n<br />Both files contains just meshes and they are not fully tested, consider them as beta.                    \n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3]Do notice, some screenshot do refer to the old 1.0 version,\xa0 the newer ones are named v.1.1.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][size=3]This was my first contribute in Skyrim, I just updated and duplicated it to the Special Edition.[/size][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Have fun!\n<br />\n<br />Kajuan\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]I8n4_m1TNQs[/youtube] [youtube]WiMmwarjNSY[/youtube]\n<br />[size=2]Video to the left by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/40163865/?tb=videos&amp;pUp=1]AbsoluteAesthetic[/url]  (youtube channel: [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFutpXSiMflNVbEmbVKc_Q]Absolute Aesthetic[/url]).

I'm using Mod Organizer, I did found it safe, clean and versatile ones you get used to. Look a bit scaring at the start but after you are used to it everything is a lot more easy to manage. \"Virtualizing\" the Data folder could sounds weird but it leave you the possibility to try, undo, change anything, by just clicking, checking, unchecking, dragging without even touching the real game folder or even creating copies of the files. It just doesn't overwrite anything for real. The author, Tannin, that I can't thank enough, has been pure genius doing it. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]COMPATIBILITY:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />They could not work as intended if you installed some different draugr meshes (body, armor) then vanilla one.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]TOOLS USED:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />DDSopt to extract files.\n<br />Adobe Photoshop[/size][size=3][size=3] with the dds plugin [/size]to work on textures.\n<br />Nifskope just to quick preview the textures over the meshes.\n<br />Notepad for the xml fomod packages.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]CREDITS and THANKS:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Bethesda.\n<br />Nexusmods.\n<br />The whole modding community.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]PERMISSION NOTES:[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][size=2]If you show in same way my assets in public places you must and should always credit the author.\n<br />These files are Nexusmod exclusive unless I give specific permission and instructions.
