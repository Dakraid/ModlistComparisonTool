nexusDescription="I wasn't happy with the way the vanilla Blades Armor looked on my female Dovahkiin so I made some simple edits to the mesh to make it look more \"practical.\" So, there's no boob-plate (chest armor is more like the male variant) and it isn't as unrealistically skinny as it was for my character, but it still has female proportions.\n<br />HD textures not included.\n<br />Just a mesh change, so it's compatible with any texture changing mods as long as those mods don't change the model. If they do, just load this mod after that one so this overwrites its models.\n<br />\n<br />Recommended:\n<br />aMidianBorn Blades Armor ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41731]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41731[/url])- HD texture replacer for the armor used in the screenshots. It also comes with its own meshes, so load this before my mod if you use it.\n<br />\n<br />Hope you enjoy!"
