nexusDescription="[b][color=#1e84cc][size=5]The Northerner Diaries - Immersive Edition\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[/size][/size][/color][/b][size=4]This mod adds a number of songs from Jeremy Soule's [i]The Northerner Diaries [/i]as exploration tracks in Skyrim and Solstheim. Thought has been put into the choice of tracks and playlists to ensure your immersion is never ruined by inappropriately-placed music.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3](Soule's bandcamp has been totally obliterated. The album is still available on [url=https://www.amazon.com/Northerner-Diaries-Symphonic-Sketches/dp/B07F3MZFSQ]amazon[/url]\xfeff in reduced quality.)[/size][/size]\n<br />[size=4]\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#1e84cc]What you will find:[/color][/b][/size][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Only 8 tracks have been chosen from the album. The remaining 5 did not make the cut for a number of reasons, mostly because I felt they didn't fit as mellow exploration tracks for Skyrim. Take Bifrost, which sounds like the opening track for a 90s Christmas movie.\n<br />[*]Of these, one (Jafnan) was edited to remove the opening drum riff, because blaring drums are the last thing you want to hear while sneaking through Skyrim's shadowed forests. As of 1.2, Ginnung was edited to remove the fanfare towards the end of the track, and the result was split into two separate tracks.\n<br />[*]For Solstheim, only the Mountain and Snow playlists have been edited. Solstheim General (which usually plays updated versions of Morrowind music) was not touched, to preserve that ashlands atmosphere.\n<br />[*]The tracks have been sorted as Day, Night, and General. The Day tracks are slightly more upbeat, and will play in towns, forests, coasts, and the tundra. The Night tracks are truly fantastic and can play anywhere at night, except towns. The General tracks can play at any time, and are scattered around different playlists.\n<br />[*]Rather than being a measly 48kbps, these files run at 192kbps, the maximum allowed bitrate for .wxm files.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />I used the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73100]Yakitori Audio Converter[/url]\xfeff to convert the original bandcamp .flac files to .wxm. \n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This mod is incompatible with any other mod that edits vanilla Skyrim music types. That includes my other music mod, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21439]Solstheim Soundtracks in Skyrim[/url]. Use a bashed patch, or take 5 mins to make a manual patch in SSEdit.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#1e84cc]Changelog:[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.2\n<br />- Added two new tracks (\"Ginnung\", split into two tracks to remove an immersion-breaking fanfare)\n<br />Version 1.1\n<br />- Fixed Dawnguard conflict, eclipse tracks will now play properly.\n<br />Version 1.0 \n<br />- Initial release.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#1e84cc]My other mods:\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30005]Sami Hut - Cosy Player Home[/url]\xfeff[/size][/size]\n<br />[/color][/b][color=#1e84cc][color=#ffffff][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23735]Solitude Rectory - Tiny Imperial Temple Home[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22427]Mhulchazn - Morrowind Dwemer Home[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21250]Nordic Lore Integration - The Stone of Snow-Throat[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20836]Dol Khazun - Orc Stronghold Player Home[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21439]Solstheim Soundtracks in Skyrim\n<br />\n<br />[/url][/color][/color][/size]Jeremy Soule has granted blanket permission for modders to use the Northerner Diaries.\n<br />The original tweet is gone but an article about it can be found [url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201224205520/https://www.vgr.com/skyrim-composer-modders-permission/]here[/url]."
