nexusDescription="[b][color=#00ffff][size=4]Description\n<br />[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Changes the outfits and classes of the quest givers and targets in The Dark Brotherhood Forever radiant quests.\n<br />ESL and ESP flagged ESL options are available, so it won't take up a plugin slot.\n<br />\n<br />[b]NPCs altered:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Blasphemous Priest - Given the monk/priest outfit, and the priest class. So now he seems like a priest.\n<br />[*]Dishonored Skald -\xa0Given the simple leather armor outfit, a lute, a steel sword, and the bard class. He's really a skald now.\n<br />[*]Visiting Noble - Given the fine clothes (\"01\") outfit with a hat, and the 1 handed warrior class. Fits his dagger.\n<br />[*]Reckless Mage - Given the spellsword class. Seemed more fitting than a wizard, with his light armor.\n<br />[*]Seasoned Hunter - Given the ranger class. Now he knows how to hunt.\n<br />[*]Poor Fishwife - Given the beggar class. They're wearing the outfit of a beggar already, anyway.\n<br />[*]Coldhearted Gravedigger - Given the citizen class. Gravediggers aren't really the warrior-y types.\n<br />[*]Beautiful Barbarian - Given the scaled armor outfit without a helmet, and the barbarian class. Grug smash.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Incompatible with any mods that edit the same NPC records directly.\n<br />(At 300+ plugins and I've had 0 conflicts.\xa0Let me know if you see one, I'm actually kinda curious.)\n<br />\n<br />Compatible with nearly everything else. When in doubt, check in SSEEdit for conflicts.\n<br />Compatible and recommended to use with\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43490]Bald Astrid for Dark Brotherhood Ending[/url], if you want another logic tweak.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff][size=4]Install &amp; Uninstall\n<br />[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Install through your mod manager or drop into your data folder.\n<br />Existing saves won't have it take affect until the quest is completed/the NPC(s) despawn, to my knowledge.
