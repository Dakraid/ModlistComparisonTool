nexusDescription="With thanks to my friends [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/67410746]Simon Magus[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/5646623]Andrealphus[/url], whose feedback was invaluable for improving the mod and in motivating me to actually finish it.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/100003]LE[/url][/size]\n<br />Silent Moons Camp is a ruined nordic structure, around which bandits have built a small camp, supplementing the existing architecture with their own structures where needed.\n<br />I took that, and turned it up to 11.\n<br />Silent Moons Camp is still a ruined structure, but it's expanded a bit in every direction. There's more wall and more towers, and where the ancient ruins have collapsed, the gaps are bridged by stockade structures to create a blend of the decay of nordic ruins and the tenacious industry of bandit forts, continuing to beg the question of which bandits are secretly master carpenters and practicing structural engineers.\n<br />In addition to heavily modifying the camp, there are a few other changes.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#42b3e3][size=5][b]Reawakening the Lunar Forge[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />In the vanilla game, the Silent Moons Enchantment is a pretty terrible enchantment. It's only active half the time, it's visual effects are boring, and the damage isn't very good - it doesn't even do damage without the unofficial patch. The in-game notes say it's supposed to behave vampirically, but instead it's flagged as fire damage.\n<br />I decided to fix this discrepancy and make lunar damage a somewhat competitive enchantment, as well as give it more interesting visual effects. So I edited the vanilla Silent Moons enchantment and added two new versions. One is an improved version of the basic enchantment that increases in damage as the moon fills, and one is a more efficient absorb health enchantment.\n<br />Once the lunar forge has been awakened, any weapon crafted there will have a leveled version of one of the three lunar enchantments, depending on how much the lunar forge has been awakened. The Notes on the Lunar Forge book has been updated to give some cryptic clues on how to proceed. Alternatively, more specific instructions can be read in the spoiler below.\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[color=#42b3e3][size=5][b]Moon Pearls for the Moon Forge! Skulls for the Skull Throne![/b][/size][/color]\n<br />The first step to reawakening the Lunar Forge is to collect moon pearls. You'll need 5 to reactivate the forge; there are 17 in-game, because I hate the Stones of Barenziah quest as much as the rest of you. Moon Pearls can be found in the area surrounding Whiterun Hold, mostly within Whiterun proper, or nearby areas in Falkreath, Haafingar, and Eastmarch. They can be found in vampire dungeons, or harvested from Giant Oysters found in bodies of water. For specific locations, see the spoiler below. Gathering five moon pearls for the forge will allow you to craft weapons with the basic lunar damage enchantment while the moons are out. It should be obvious the forge is active due to the pillars of light.\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]5 Giant Oysters within Lake Ilinalta\n<br />[spoiler][*]at the foot of the Lady Stone\n<br />[*]at the tributary near Half-Moon Mill\n<br />[*]on a sunken fragment of Ilinalta's Deep\n<br />[*]at the shipwreck\n<br />[*]in the nordic burial mound\n<br />[/spoiler][*]1 Giant Oyster in the river at Greenspring Hollow\n<br />[*]1 Giant Oyster in the river outside Orotheim\n<br />[*]1 Giant Oyster in the pool on the Dragonsreach stairs\n<br />[*]1 Giant Oyster outside Robber's Gorge\n<br />[*]1 Giant Oyster in the White River at Valtheim\n<br />[*]1 Moon Pearl in the basement of Dragonsreach, near the Whispering Door\n<br />[*]1 Moon Pearl at Silent Moons Camp, in the collapsed tower\n<br />[*]1 Moon Pearl in Broken Fang Cave\n<br />[*]1 Moon Pearl in the Moldering Ruins\n<br />[*]1 Moon Pearl in Shriekwind Bastion\n<br />[*]1 Moon Pearl in Mara's Eye Pond\n<br />[*]1 Moon Pearl in Pinewood Cave\n<br />[/list][/spoiler]\n<br />[color=#42b3e3][size=5][b]Pointy Bit First[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />The next step of awakening the Lunar Forge requires sticking a sword into the giant stone head at the front of the forge. A silver sword will allow you to craft weapons with the awakened lunar damage enchantment, and an ebony sword will allow you to craft weapons with the lunar health absorb enchantment. Note that for both of these, you'll have to have gathered 5 moon pearls to activate the forge further.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#42b3e3][size=5][b]Claiming Silent Moons Camp[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29882][img]https://i.imgur.com/WpA4iBP.png[/img][/url]\n<br />Silent Moons Camp can be claimed for Whiterun Hold, the Empire, or the Stormcloaks. This uses the Lawbringer framework. If you do not have the framework active, the mod will disable the ability to claim the camp. The guards for whichever faction you claim it for will have a small chance of spawning with lunar versions of their regular weapons.\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/52904][img]https://i.imgur.com/cET5e0Z.png[/img][/url][/center]"
