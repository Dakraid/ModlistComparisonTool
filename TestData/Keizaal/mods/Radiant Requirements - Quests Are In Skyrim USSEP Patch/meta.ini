nexusDescription="[color=#b4a7d6][size=5]Overview[/size][/color]\n<br />This mod allows you to configure radiant quests to avoid sending you to certain dungeon types if your character level is too low. For example, this can prevent you from being sent to fight dangerous Falmer at the beginning of the game when your character would struggle to defeat them.\n<br />\n<br />The following quests will restrict their possible dungeon types based on your character level and the MCM settings:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Trouble in Skyrim (CR05)\n<br />[*]Family Heirloom (CR06)\n<br />[*]Rescue Mission (CR08)\n<br />[*]Dungeon Delving (Caves) (Favor205)\n<br />[*]Dead Treasure Hunter with instructions (WE100)\n<br />[*]Lost Relic (DLC1RH08)\n<br />[*]Ancient Power (DLC1RV05)\n<br />[*]Wind and Sand (DLC2TTR3b)\n<br />[*]Azra's Staffs (DLC2TTR7)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />In addition, these quests have been modified:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Trouble in Skyrim (CR05) - Can now send you to Giant camps if your level is high enough\n<br />[*]Dungeon Delving (Jarl - Hagravens) (Favor157) - Minimum level follows Hagraven setting in MCM\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][size=5]INI Settings[/size][/color]\n<br />From v1.2.0, the MCM feature is based on [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53000]MCM Helper[/url] and supports saving of persistent settings. Your MCM settings will get saved to [i]Data&#92;MCM&#92;Settings&#92;RadiantRequirements.ini[/i]. You can also edit this file outside the game if you like. If you are updating from an earlier version, the settings from your save file will also get written to the INI file, so you should update your save first if you are planning on changing the INI settings."
