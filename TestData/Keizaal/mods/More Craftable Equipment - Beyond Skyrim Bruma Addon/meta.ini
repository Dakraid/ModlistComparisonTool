nexusDescription="[b][size=3]Summary[/size][/b]\xfeff\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />The excellent mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44666]More Craftable Equipment[/url] creates a new crafting station, the Loom, and enables recipes for a variety of common clothes and also unlockable crafts such as Tsun's outfit or unenchanted faction gear. This mod extends this feature to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917]Beyond Skyrim: Bruma[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Two Looms are added to Bruma- one in the Castle Service Hall, opposite the kitchen. The other is in the basement of White Pine Lodge with the other crafting stations, and will appear after the relevant upgrade for the house is purchased.\n<br />\n<br />Standard Cyrodiilic clothing will appear after completing the quest 'Welcome to Cyrodiil'.\n<br />\n<br />Revenant Necromancer Robes, Hood, and Mask will be unlocked upon completing the quest 'Undeath at Underpall'.\n<br />\n<br />Synod Robes and Hood are unlocked upon completing the quest 'Whispers of the Mountain'.\n<br />\n<br />College of Whispers Robes and Hood are unlocked after completing the misc task offered by Ravil Fandrani.\n<br />\n<br />I intend to update this for future Beyond Skyrim releases, including the full version of Cyrodiil. At that time there will likely be changes, such as making the Synod/College robes available only after officially joining those factions.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Installation[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Simply download and install with the mod manager of your choice (Recommended) or manually extract to your Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][b]Compatibility[/b][/b]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />A version is available for\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35334]Synod and Whisper Robes Improved[/url]\xfeff, so that the Loom creates unenchanted versions (Does not actually require that mod as a master). Should otherwise be compatible with anything that doesn't also edit the Bruma Castle Service Hall or White Pine Lodge Basement (None that I'm aware of).\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][url=https://www.patreon.com/ultimategaymer]Patreon[/url]\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b][size=2]I now have a patreon, if you enjoy my mods and would like to support me, I would greatly appreciate it. However, my mods will never be paywalled or offered early to patrons, so don't worry. It's purely to help me have to focus less on real life and more on modding.[/size]"
