nexusDescription="[b][color=#3c78d8][size=3]Introduction[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Immersion and Lore Continuity[/b] features a number of tweaks and additions which are based on reference lore as described in the game, or in in-universe books, or dialogues, and other sources with the aim of adding to the narrative storytelling and flavour of the game.\n<br />\n<br />Each tweaks is designed to be [i]lightweight[/i], [i]non-intrusive[/i], [i]immersive[/i], and [i]as highly compatible as possible[/i]. All the plugins are marked as esl and do not take up an esp slot.\n<br />\n<br />This is an on-going project and more modules will be added when developed.\n<br />\n<br />This mod can be considered a revival of\xa0[b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74152]Lore Continuity Fixes[/url]\xfeff\xa0[/b]project[b]\xa0[/b]by\xa0steveowashere, as well as a consolidation of similar existing lore-based tweaks.\n<br />\n<br />Changes from the Unofficial Patch have been forwarded where relevant.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#ffd966][size=3][b]List of all current modules:[/b][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]1. [b]Dented Iron Shields [b]look\xa0[/b]dented[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dented_Iron_Shield]Dented Iron Shield[/url] is an item added by Dragonborn DLC and can usually be found on\xa0\x61nd looted from the new Draugr variant Hulking Draugr.\n<br />\n<br />This file makes the shield look visibly deformed to appear appropriate to its 25% lower armor rating compared to a regular Iron Shield.\xa0This module has a script which runs just once instead of a direct esp record edit for maximum compatibility and least headache. This module requires SKSE (version independent).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]2.\xa0[b]Nightingale's\xa0\x45tching\xa0[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[i]\"Take my hand Lady Nocturnal, for it's my will to serve you. As a Nightingale, I'm born anew. Let my past echo our triumph.\"[/i] - Lorthus\n<br />\n<br />This etching was made on a stone block\xa0in Dragonsreach prison where a Dunmer named Lorthus was imprisoned as per this [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nightingales:_Fact_or_Fiction%3F]dissertation[/url].\n<br />\n<br />This file adds this etching to a cell in Whiterun prison which can be activated to read clearly.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]3. [b]Farengar purchases Dragon Remains[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Farengar Secret-Fire is the Court Wizard of Whiterun and an avid researcher of Dragons.\n<br />[spoiler]When Odahviing is trapped\xa0in the Great Hall in the main quest, Farengar expresses desire to pry off one of its scales.[/spoiler]\n<br />With this plugin, he will purchase Dragon bones, scales, and heart scales from the player.\n<br />\n<br />This particular module requires SKSE and\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854]powerofthree's Papyrus Extender for SSE[/url]\xfeff and has a script which runs just once instead of a direct esp record edit\xa0\x66or maximum compatibility and least headache.\n<br />\n<br />Speaking of headaches...\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]4. [b]Nightmare debuffs in Dawnstar[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Dawnstar's inhabitants are plagued by nightmares and restless nights, and will continue to suffer until the\xa0[url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Waking_Nightmare]Waking Nightmare[/url]\xfeff has ended.\n<br />\n<br />In the vanilla game there is no effect on the player if they sleep in Dawnstar even before the related quest is completed, and can even obtain the \"rested\" bonuses like anywhere else.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Disclaimer: There is a dialogue in the vanilla game that claims that the nightmares do not affect travelers, so if you are playing a character who has settled down in Dawnstar then this module will be appropriate. if not then it is up to your discretion.\n<br />[/i]\n<br />With this file, if the player sleeps in Dawnstar they too will suffer from corrupted dreams and will find themselves tormented and less able to improve their skills over the next eight hours. This debuff can be seen in the Active Effects menu.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]5. [b]Valuable Balmora Blue[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Described as \"beyond valuable\", this contraband is worth a mere 67 Septims in the vanilla game.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />With this file the item's value is changed to 1000 Septims, 500 less than what the smuggler\xa0[url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sabine_Nytte]Sabine Nytte[/url]\xa0\x64\x65mands of the player in the related quest. This change is [b]purely cosmetic[/b] as the item can not be sold or used by the player in regular game-play. The item is [b]edited directly and there may be conflicts[/b] with mods which also edit the item, so the plugin load order needs to be kept in mind.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]6. [b]The 418th Step[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />From the ancient tales of the\xa0[url=http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Five_Songs_of_King_Wulfharth]Five Songs of King Wulfharth[/url]\xfeff, the Second Song mentions that the 418th step on the path to High Hrothgar was damaged by a dragon.\n<br />\n<br />It also mentions that the step was subsequently rebuilt by King Wulfharth and this was one of his deeds which were witnessed by the Old Gods and lauded.\n<br />\n<br />This file adds a pedestal with an etching on it on the path to High Hrothgar near Emblem II and can be activated to view an ancient proclamation regarding the special step.\n<br />\n<br />The pedestal's location is inspired from Chesko's mod for LE\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19107/]The 418th Step[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]7. [b]Castle Dour banners[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Castle Dour in Solitude is adorned in numerous Imperial banners. In the vanilla game, if the Civil War ends with a Stormcloak victory a\xa0 Stormcloak Commander takes over the Castle but the Imperial banners remain draped.\n<br />\n<br />With this file, the Imperials banners are replaced by Stormcloak/Windhelm Hold banners found in Windhelm's Palace of the Kings if and when Stormcloaks take control of Solitude at the end of the Civil War.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#8e7cc3][size=3]Installation[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Each plugin is marked as esp-light and does not take up an esp slot.\n<br />\n<br />The mod (any modules) can be installed mid-game.\n<br />\n<br />The Main File is a FOMOD\xa0installer where players can choose which of the files to install.\n<br />\n<br />Uninstallation of any module mid-game is not recommended and not supported.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#93c47d][size=3]Compatibility and Load Order[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />The mod has been designed for [b]maximum compatibility[/b], utilising scripts rather than record edits where possible thus making load order of the plugins irrelevant.\n<br />\n<br />There's an exception in the case of Valuable Balmora Blue for which the load order matters.\n<br />\n<br />If any incompatibilities or issues are found please report them.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[i][color=#e69138][size=3]Comment your ideas for more such small immersion/lore based tweaks.[/size][/color][/i]"
