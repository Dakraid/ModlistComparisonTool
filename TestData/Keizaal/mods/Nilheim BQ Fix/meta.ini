nexusDescription="[color=#f1c232]What it does[/color]: the Nilheim bandits can respawn and, after the Telrav quest, behave like normal brigands.\n<br />Console-addicted players might as well skip this.\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]I also took the liberty of renaming the crooks to \"Bandit\" right from the start; setting up a quest just to rename them later felt like a waste of game resources [and a possible source of conflicts].\n<br />I know they're supposed to be \"Guard\" to cleverly deceive the clueless player who approaches the tower without getting the quest from Telrav but... they live in what's obviously a bandit camp, \"guarding\" a few corpses most likely thrown from the tower; they're supposed to be Telrav's guards but don't even bother looking for him while he's 50 meters away and the \"wounded\" Telrav doesn't bother to give them a holler and ask for help, he needs [i]your[/i] help... the game's afoot, Watson.\n<br />Instead of awkward guards, they'll be bandits taking a break between banditing shifts.[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />USSEP isn't required but it fixes errors in the Telrav quest. Better have that, too."
