nexusDescription="Destroy the Dark Brotherhood is a weird quest. The quest starts from the premise \"No, I actually don't want to murder for hire, and in fact I think all of the assassins who do should be killed instead.\" However, to start that quest, the first thing you have to do for that quest is accept a small child's contract to murder an adult, while pretending to be a member of the Dark Brotherhood. That's a [i]weird thing to do[/i] if you're against murder for hire. Then you have to wait for Astrid to abduct you and start your job interview before killing her, which, again, is a strange thing for someone who does not want to be an assassin to be involved in.\n<br />\n<br />Dark Brotherhood Rising: Revengeance, aside from having the best name of any mod on the Nexus, is about providing an alternate route to start the Destroy the Dark Brotherhood quest. Instead of completing Innocence Lost and waiting to be abducted, you can now rarely find a map on the unnamed Dark Brotherhood assassins that start attacking you after level 5. Reading the map will trigger a miscellaneous objective to follow it, and once you've found the Sanctuary, you'll be directed through Destroy the Dark Brotherhood as usual. At any time before actually telling a guard about the Sanctuary, you can resume the Dark Brotherhood questline. The alternate route will stop once you've been abducted by Astrid.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#42b3e3][size=5][b]Credits[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />Thanks to Jelidity for the map image.\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/52904][img]https://i.imgur.com/cET5e0Z.png[/img][/url][/center]"
