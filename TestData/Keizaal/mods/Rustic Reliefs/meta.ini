nexusDescription="[font=Arial][size=4][color=#9fc5e8]\xfeffRUSTIC RELIEFS[/color] is a collection of several of my Skyrim LE mods. This package includes the textures for [color=#9fc5e8]RUSTIC MONUMENTS &amp; TOMBSTONES[/color], [color=#9fc5e8]RUSTIC NORDIC MURALS[/color], [color=#9fc5e8]RUSTIC STANDING STONES[/color], and [color=#9fc5e8]RUSTIC WORD WALLS[/color]. Since all these retextures involved raised carvings, I thought it only natural to host them together.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]RUSTIC MONUMENTS &amp; TOMBSTONES[/color]\xa0is a retexture of the Windhelm monument wall, king stones, and tombstones.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]RUSTIC NORDIC MURALS[/color]\xa0is a retexture of the carved stone murals found in old Nordic ruins and dungeons. You will commonly see them in the inner \"sanctum\" areas where the puzzle doors are found. \xfeffT[/size][/font][font=Arial][size=4]here are 11 mural designs in total, the 9 unique center designs, and the 2 lintel designs (the top headpiece, and the side design). The characters are as follows: Bear, Dragon, Fox, Hawk, Moth, Owl, Snake, Whale, and Wolf[/size][size=4]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]RUSTIC STANDING STONES[/color]\xa0retextures the 13 Standing Stones (or birthstones) found in Skyrim. I was never happy with the appearance of the vanilla textures, as they looked too smooth and not at all like the ancient artifacts that they represented.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]RUSTIC WORD WALLS[/color]\xa0is a retexture of the dragonshout walls located above and below ground, though most commonly on Skyrim's mountains where they are guarded by dragons.\n<br />\n<br />Since all these textures cover large objects, I am only offering them in 2K resolution, as anything smaller would not appear detailed enough in game.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4][color=#00ffff][b]UPDATE:[/b][/color] I've added a file to the Optional Downloads section that's provided by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/930789-kulharin/][b]Kulharin[/b][/url]. This file adds parallax textures (with edited meshes) to my RUSTIC RELIEF mod. In order for the\xa0parallax effect to work properly, you need to also download two other mods. You need both [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31963]SSE Parallax Shader Fix (Beta)[/url], and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9121?tab=files]Better Dynamic Snow SE[/url]\xfeff version 2.11. Now with version 1.2, edited meshes for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/7064860]wSkeever[/url]'s [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41368]Shadow of Sunlight - In Small Exterior World Spaces[/url]\xa0mod are included.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[/font][font=Arial][size=4][b]Note:[/b] Kulharin assured me that the edited meshes are fully compatible with or/and include fixes from USSEP, SMIM, ELFX, Unofficial Material Fixes. You should also be aware that adding the parallax textures will add to your VRAM load, so it's recommended that you have a decent video card.[/size][/font][font=Arial]\n<br />[/font]\n<br />[center][youtube]OgMITKpQG9Q[/youtube][youtube]IT2_TKn_Glc[/youtube][youtube]MPQCbSrms4s[/youtube][/center]"
