I also recommend\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63353/]RUSTIC CHILDREN[/url].\n<br />If the orphan clothes aren't doing it for you, check out\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35578]HD Orphan Clothes[/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]DESCRIPTION[/b]\n<br />\n<br />At its core, I really enjoy [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8354]Prince and The Pauper[/url]. I mean...has anyone else noticed that Dagny, the Jarl's daughter, is wearing the same outfit as little orphan girl down by the Eldergleen? It's no wonder that Dagny is throwing a fit about getting a new dress! That said, every time I've introduced it to my loadorder I find myself making the same changes. Removing outfits, changing file paths, renaming items, and the cycle continues every time I come back to Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8354]Prince and The Pauper[/url]\xa0makes changes to the pool of child outfits to provide new clothing outside of the 3 found in the base game. Noble children will wear noble dresses and tunics. Middle class children will wear more basic clothing. Urchin children will wear rags. You will also be able to purchase the newly added clothing at stores and gift your adopted children any of the new clothing to wear.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70037]Prince and The Pauper Refine[/url] is my own personal author cut of this mod. Along with a handful of bug and texture fixes, consistency edits, redone outfits, and my own personal changes, I've also devised a way to require [b]zero NPC record edits[/b], making this immediately compatible with any mod that edits child appearances. I was too lazy to actually download every child overhaul and make a patch. No content from the original mods is used, so you will have to install the following..\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]INSTALLATION[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Because this mod relies on a specific content, installation instructions are as follows.\n<br />\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 Download [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8354]Prince and The Pauper SE[/url].\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 Select the [b][u]Rustic Clothing[/u][/b] option in the installer.\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 Download [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4703]RUSTIC CLOTHING[/url].\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 Download\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869]Spell Perk Item Distributor[/url].\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 Install\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70037]this mod[/url] and let it overwrite all content.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70037]Prince and The Pauper Refine[/url] comes with a replacer [b].esp[/b]\xa0\x66or the original plugin.\n<br />This will remove the NPC records modified by the mod for maximum compatibility.\n<br />If you'd like to sort out the conflicts on your own, feel free to delete the replacer plugin.\n<br />\n<br />These mods are absolutely required to get the intended experience.\n<br />If you don't use the children outfits from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4703]RUSTIC CLOTHING[/url], the names will not match the outfit colors.\n<br />Please remember to [color=#ffd966][b]endorse[/b][/color] the original mods if you haven't already.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/q75IWEK.gif[/img][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b]CHANGES[/b]\n<br />\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 Outfits have been given more generic children names.\n<br />       \x25a0\xa0 [i]Boy's Dragon Tunic (ClothesChild01Male) -&gt; Boy's Outfit, Red (ClothesChild01Male)[/i]\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 Outfits have consistent colors between genders, like in vanilla.\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 Outfits have been given updated normal maps where applicable.\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 Most base game outfits have had their textures reverted back to Vanilla, to let Rustic Clothing win.\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 Certain outfits have hand-selected certain retextures from Prince and Pauper.\n<br />       \x25a0\xa0 [i]Boy's Lumberjack Tunic (ClothesChild03Male) -&gt; Boy's Outfit, Yellow (ClothesChild05Male)[/i]\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 Certain outfits have had their shoes switched back to vanilla for consistency.\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 Certain actors are given new outfits. Mila and Fjotra's orange dress was a bit loud in my opinion.\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 The leveled lists have been slightly revised. Purchase all items from clothing stores right out of the gate.\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 The gift list has been slightly revised. You can gift boys dolls now. [i][b]Feature creep at it's finest![/b][/i]\n<br />     \x25a0\xa0 Probably more...\n<br />\n<br />Addons have been included for\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66955]Honorhall Orphanage Bugfixes and Expansion[/url], [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bloodchill_Manor]Bloodchill Manor[/url], and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194]Interesting NPCs[/url].\n<br />Patching with SPID is very convenient, so let me know if there's something I missed.\n<br />\n<br />[b]COMPATIBILITY[/b]\n<br />\n<br />I don't use a child overhaul. I personally use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63353/]RUSTIC CHILDREN[/url].\n<br />But I have devised a patching method that will require no additional plugin in most circumstances.\n<br />Simply install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869]Spell Perk Item Distributor[/url] and outfits will be distributed to the NPCs automatically.\n<br />Additionally, patches for mods that add children will have their own SPID _DISTR.ini configuration file.\n<br />\n<br />If you have already adopted a child, gifted them an outfit, and are around them, they may not have shoes or instead wear rags.\n<br />In this case, please open the console, select the actor with your cursor, and type in\xa0[code]resetinventory[/code].\n<br />This is just how changing outfit records works with existing saves. There's really not a whole lot I can do.\n<br />\n<br />[b]RECOMMENDED MODS[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/493]Dressed Hearthfire Doll[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63353/]RUSTIC CHILDREN[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]RECOGNITION[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Thank you to the rest of r/skyrimmods Discord for providing feedback on this project.\n<br />Thank you to JadeRoyale for creating [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/46156/]Prince and The Pauper[/url].\n<br />Thank you to Gamwich for creating [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5712421]Rustic Clothing[/url]."
