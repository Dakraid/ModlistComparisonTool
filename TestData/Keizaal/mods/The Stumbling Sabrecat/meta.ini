nexusDescription="The inn reopens when Fort Dunstad is occupied by a garrison -- clients and decor match the current fort ownership.\n<br />Not that [i]another[/i] inn was sorely needed, it's just for immersion.\n<br />No posh interiors or lustful wenches [well, not too lustful] but they do serve the best cheese.[spoiler][youtube]zB8pbUW5n1g[/youtube][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f1c232][size=3]Compatibility[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[b]Must be loaded after mods that edit the same cell.[/b]\n<br />I'm aware of [i]\"Medieval Lanterns of Skyrim\"[/i], [i]\"Relighting Skyrim\"[/i], and [i]\"Remove Interior Fog\"[/i].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][b]Patch[/b][/color] for [i]\"Rigmor of Bruma\"[/i] -- the restored inn is accessible only after having completed the \"Enemy of my Enemy\" quest.\n<br />I also took the liberty of adjusting a conversation scene which is supposed to run after the fight inside the inn -- it looked like that \n<br />sometimes it might have been skipped.\n<br />The patch in the installer is for the new \"Reboot\" version. \n<br />In the \"miscellaneous files\" I uploaded the old patch for the \"Legacy\" version, just in case."
