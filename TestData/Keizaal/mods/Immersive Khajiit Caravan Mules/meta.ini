nexusDescription="This mod is based on and inspired by the mod\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12996]Mule Skinner's Farm[/url] by\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/78745]noraimironhand[/url]. Along with a lot of other things I wasn't interested in, that mod also adds the cool feature of mules to the Khajiit Caravans. But the inclusion of the mules wasn't done in a proper way. So I set out on a quest to add mules to the Khajiit Caravans in a proper and immersive way, taking Mule Skinner's Farm as a starting point. The meshes for the mules and their gear comes from Mule Skinner's Farm. Please give noraimironhand kudos for their work.\n<br />\n<br />Ever wondered how the Khajiit Caravans are able to transport their shit, even though there are no signs in the game that they have means of transporting all those tents and wares? You no longer have to be amazed by their transportive magic skills, because now every Khajiit Caravan has two pack mules. Much immersion!\n<br />\n<br />[b]What this mod does:[/b]\n<br />- Adds two pack mules per caravan that travels with the Khajiit, so a total of six mules are added. I created custom AI packages for them.\n<br />- Three of the mules have a slightly brighter texture, and three of the mules have a slightly darker texture. For visual variety. \n<br />- Offers an optional file for those who want only one colour, the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13211]Missouri retexture[/url] by\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/41345665]Kyubitron[/url].\n<br />- Offers an optional file changing all the Mules into full blown donkeys. Hee-haw! Based on this [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5201727]mod[/url]. Model created by the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/enderalspecialedition]Enderal[/url] team and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5201727]jayserpa[/url].\n<br />- The mules are allied to the Khajiit Caravan Guard faction, so if you attack them you'll feel the wrath of the rest of the caravan.\n<br />- At every camp the mules have a designed resting spot with some hay that only enables when the Khajiit set up camp. For those wondering, I added 2 xMarkerHeadings and 2 pieces of hay at every caravan camp, set to enable only when the camp is set up. Basically, it links into vanilla caravan camp system.\n<br />- When the mules are travelling they carry crates on their backs.\n<br />- When the mules are resting at camp they automatically unequip their crates, so they can actually take a load off. I did this by creating a custom papyrus fragment script that fires one time when the mules reach their resting spot. When Khajiit are ready to hit the road again and break up camp, the script fires again and re-equips all the mules their crates. The changing of the Mule equipment only triggers upon leaving the area and coming back.\n<br />- Mules are set to essential.\n<br />\n<br />That's it. That's all there is to it. This is an immersion mod, so it literally does nothing else. No bloat, no additional features, just a lightweight mod to hopefully help liven up your game a bit.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Notes[/b]\n<br />- It seems that Bethesda originally envisioned for the Khajiit Caravans to have horse accompanying the caravan; there is an unused template for CaravanHorses in the game files (if you check in xEdit you can see I actually referred to this template :). I guess this mod kind of delivers what was already envisioned by Bethesda!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\n<br />- Compatible with Cutting Room Floor\n<br />- Compatible with Khajiit Caravan Kittens if you download the patch I provided.\n<br />- If you are using any other mods that change the Khajiit Caravan camps (there are not a lot, I searched) it could be that the Mules' resting spots clip with new additions.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Future plans that might or might not happen\n<br />[/b][s]- Check compatibility with Cutting Room Floor, that supposedly adds a NPC called\xa0Grushnag to one of the Caravans (will most likely happen)[/s]\n<br />[s]- I plan on at least checking compatibility with Khajiit Caravan Children, and hopefully providing a compatibility patch (will most likely happen)[/s]\n<br /> - Add some more idle markers and clutter to the Caravan camps (maybe)\n<br />- I would like to create an optional module to adds one more inconsequential npc per caravan (maybe)\n<br />- Adding an extra stop to the Khajiit Caravans at the houses added by Hearthfire. I might start with one, then build from there (very unlikely)"
