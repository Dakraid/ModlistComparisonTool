nexusDescription="I always felt like it was a bit lazy of Bethesda's part to make separate clothes for these quests, but not even give it a custom texture! So i recolored the vanilla clothing pieces to have unique and interesting textures that reflects their purpose. Such mod already exists, made by\xa0PhilSchmidheiny, but it's for LE, so i remade the mod myself from scratch. Works for both female, male.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5]Reasoning behind these color choices[/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />Radiant Raiment: In the quest \"Fit for a Jarl\", you are tasked with showing Elisif the Fair, an unique piece of clothing. Although, said piece of clothing, is not unique at all and is wore by many solitude citizens. Poor Elisif must have lied so you'd get a nice piece of clothing and some money. Well, not anymore. I changed the jewels of the clothing to a blue sapphire/aquamarine-like color and the piece now has a royal purple/wine color to it, donning a white fabulous fur, \"Fit for a Jarl\" if you ask me ;)\n<br />\n<br />Party Clothes: in the quest \"Diplomatic Immunity\", you are to infiltrate the Thalmor Embassy and face Elenwen with style as an undercover guest. Delphine must have took her Party Clothes from an old chest covered in mud, cause you do not look like an important guest at all. Fortunately, i am here to fix Delphine's horrible fashion tastes (wish i could fix her moral views as aswell and slap some sense in her head, but, oh well). Now you'll be wearing a stylish Black &amp; White outfit, worthy of an important guest of Elenwen's guest list.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5]Requirements and Installation\n<br />[/size][/center]You'll need nothing but Skyrim and a good sense of fashion! (Who is this one kidding? Khajiit is everything but fashionable!) Download this mod through your favorite mod manager and all should be good. To install manually (if you dislike mod managers), simply put the files where they are supposed to be. All goes in the data folder!\n<br />You can put it anywhere you want in the load order, it shouldn't be incompatible\xa0with anything, unless a mod changes these articles of clothing, like\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3915/?tab=1&amp;navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrimspecialedition%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D3915%26preview%3D1]Noble Dress[/url]\xfeff,\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13301/]Colovian Noble Clothes - Replacer for Quest Outfits[/url]\xfeff,\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13167/]Exquisite Clothing[/url]\xfeff,\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9241/]Shiva's Vanilla Clothing Replacer[/url]\xfeff, then it should be placed after them, so it prioritizes my mod. I can't garantee it will work, for khajiit doesn't use such mods. Before installing any mods, you should always make a backup save!\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5]Questions\n<br />[/size][/center]\n<br />User: This file is an esp!! Why are you feeding our load orders with unecessary esps?! This is just a recolor, for crying out loud!\n<br />\n<br />Do'kharin: Forgive this one, my fellow modder! But these unique clothes uses the same texture as the normal Fine Clothes in CK (Creation Kit). If Do'kharin would to simply recolor the textures pertaining\xa0to the Fine Clothes, that would change the texture for all the clothes that use the texture, not just the Radiant Raiment and Party Clothes. So it wouldn't make said clothes unique, it would destroy what this one is trying to create: a mod to make these quest items unique and to stand out on their own! Khajiit had to make duplicates of the models and texture sets and assign them into Radiant Raiment Fine/Party Clothes IDs, so an esp was necessary for such changes.\n<br />\n<br />But, if my fellow modder wishes to use these textures for normal Fine Clothes, replacing all the clothing that uses these texture, you can simply download this mod, take its texture files, rename them and put them in your data/textures/clothes/fineclothes folder, without the need for an ESP. Your clothing won't be unique, though, so you have been warned.\n<br />\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />User: Will you make an ESL version?\n<br />\n<br />Do'kharin: There is one now in the optional files, it is an esp flagged as ESL.\n<br />\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />User: Why not pack this in a bsa?\n<br />\n<br />Do'kharin: For easier changes to the files! If anyone feels brave enough to make their own recolors/retextures because they do not like the color choices this one picked, they can simply make a dds file and rename them so it works with khajiit's mod! Without having to unpack and pack it up again.\n<br />\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />User: Will you make other versions, like, maybe a black and red version for vampires or something else?\n<br />\n<br />Do'kharin: Maybe. This one chose the colors he liked better, so he is satisfied with the mod. But, khajiit is willing to make optional recolors if somebody asks. I will not promise anything though. Reply in the comment section with your idea and Do'kharin might make the recolor for you, but be very specific\xa0on the colors you wish for and where they should be applied.\n<br />\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />User: Will you make other duplicates to have unique recolored textures? What about new models??\n<br />\n<br />Do'kharin: This one will make other recolors of any other unique duplicates you can find. Khajiit is not aware of any others except for these two sets. So do tell if there is another! Unfortunately, Do'kharin does not possess modeling know-how, so he will not be able to make unique models, only retextures. Maybe when this one's kin are accepted in Skyrim's cities, he'll learn how to model and go back at this mod.\n<br />\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />User: Lmao, nobody uses vanilla textures, you dummy cat. Make a recolor using a popular retexturing mod!\n<br />\n<br />Do'kharin: Khajiit had planned to recolor these clothing sets with a very popular mod by a famous author, but unfortunately, they did not give khajiit permission to use their textures, so this one honored their decision and respects this site's rules. You'll have to settle for the vanilla textures, unless you want to recolor the textures of a popular texturing mod yourself to work with this mod, but please, do so for personal use, a modder's work needs respect.\n<br />\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />User: You know nobody wears these clothing sets... right?\n<br />\n<br />Do'kharin: This one is aware, but they should look good in your house's mannequin!\n<br />\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />User: The textures are bugged, it's only showing a plastic purple texture...\n<br />\n<br />Do'kharin: Sorry!! That was an oversight of khajiit's. When packing the mod in a .rar file this one put in unecessary spaces because he thought it woud look more organized. I didn't know spaces would cause an inconsistency in the texture pathfinding! Version 2.0 now has fixed pathfinding!\n<br />\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />User: No first person versions?\n<br />\n<br />Do'kharin: That's not a bug in Dokharin's part, it's of the vanilla game itself. For some reason, assigning textures to first person models just doesn't work as it's supposed to.\n<br />\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5]\xfeffMods used in Screenshots\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/center]Do'kharin can't remember all, but most of them are Hallgarth's Additional Hairstyles, Superior Lore-Friendly Hair Textures, Total Character Makeover, Ominous ENB, Noble Skyrim 2K, SMIM, ELFX, Obsidian Weathers and that should be about it."
