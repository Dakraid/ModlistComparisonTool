nexusDescription="This mod was previously part of my other mod Andrealphus' Gameplay Tweaks. (now named [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27939]Andrealphus' Tweaks - Harder Quests[/url])\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=4]Disclaimer: Only the [color=#a2c4c9][u]Player Grab Stealing[/u] [color=#9fc5e8]Fix[/color][/color] was made obsolete by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51073]powerofthree's Tweaks[/url]. The rest of these fixes are still relevant as far as I know. I've seen this misconception on several threads across the internet, so just to be clear, I'm putting this disclaimer here.[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Follower Favor Carry Limit[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Fixes the exploit in which you can ask a follower to pick up an item, even if they're overencumbered already.\n<br />\n<br />Now requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869]SPID[/url] to dynmaically apply to any and all relevant NPCs in your load order. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Player Grab Stealing[/b][/color][s]\n<br />\n<br />[/s][spoiler][s]\n<br />Grabbing an owned item (Z-keying) will count as stealing. (like in Oblivion) This is done to avoid dragging an owned item to a hidden place in order to steal it there.\n<br />\n<br />In addition, I removed a buggy Vanilla mechanic, which is described in [url=https://www.afkmods.com/index.php?/topic/4393-curious-design-descions-helgas-bunkhouse/]this topic[/url] because it was interfering with my tweak.\n<br />\n<br />Dragging an item will also break invisibility now.\n<br />[/s][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b6d7a8][size=2]This tweak has been made obsolete with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51073]powerofthree's Tweaks[/url], which fixes this on a native level, and as such is much cleaner and less prone to complications.\n<br />\n<br />I'm keeping this tweak up for reference, as it may proof useful to other mod authors for other purposes. I wouldn't recommend this for users; since the mod linked above is much better in that regard.[/size][/color]\n<br />[s]\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Releasing Clutter on Actors deals Damage[/b][/color][/s][color=#6fa8dc][b] Grabbing Mode Exploit Fixes[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Following items will cause damage to NPCs when you drop them on an NPCs (un-Zkey): Buckets, baskets, cast iron pots, kettles, dwarven bowls. The damage will make the NPC enter combat and/or give you a bounty. \n<br />This is done to fix the \"bucket head\" exploit.\n<br />\n<br />Now also prevents clipping though walls using plates. When attempted, the player will ragdoll and drop the item.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Don't Read Elder Scrolls While Swimming[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This small tweak prevents you from reading an Elder Scroll while swimming, as that was causing an animation glitch.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Horse Exploit Fixes[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />When you're now riding a horse on a slope with an angle of 40 degrees or more (in either direction), you'll fall off your horse.\n<br />This is done to prevent the exploit of horses running up very steep slopes.\n<br />\n<br />You can assign different values for the slope angle threshold, by using these console commands:\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[code]set ANDR_HEF_ThresholdAngleX to X[/code]\n<br />(40 by default)\n<br />\n<br />[code]set ANDR_HEF_ThresholdAngleX_Neg to X[/code]\n<br />(-40 by default)\n<br />\n<br />You can also customise the polling rate, by using this console command:\n<br />\n<br />[code]set ANDR_HEF_UpdateInterval to X\n<br />[/code]\n<br />X in time in seconds, default is 2. If set to 0, the polling effect will be disabled. The polling only occurs when on riding a horse. It shouldn't leave any harmful script effects. If you're uncertain, you can increase the polling amount, or set it to 0 to disable it.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />In addition to this, I used a workaround to fix another animation glitch, when mounting/dismounting a horse while swimming, would prevent the horse from using swimming animations and \"sprinting\" through the water.\n<br />\n<br />So, if you now mount/dismount a horse while swimming, it will use proper swimming animations.\n<br />\n<br />Note: There may a short delay for the animations of the player and/or horse to catch up, after dismounting/mounting while swimming.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Telekinesis XP exploit[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Fixes he exploit mentioned in [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbbq8RHzHEc]this video[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Basically, by using the Telekinesis spell, combined with the Secret of Arcana Power from the Dragonborn DLC, you could then fast travel to a far away location and instantly get level 100 in Alteration. This fix disables Fast Travel, as long as you are casting Telekinesis.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Standing Stones Balance and Exploit Fixes[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Standing Stones that have a \"once a day power\" (Serpent, Ritual, Shadow and Tower), now have a shared cooldown of 28,800 in game seconds. This effect persists when unequipping and re-equipping the Aetherial Crown.\n<br />\n<br />Note: This is done to fix the exploit in which you can just unequip and re-equip the Aetherial Crown to get unlimited uses.\n<br />\n<br />Ritual Stone: \n<br />\n<br />- Added Conjuration as school and added proper keywords for raising undead, so it will benefit from the Conjuration tree and perks, just like other spells of that school.\n<br />- Reduced max amount of raised creatures to a maximum of 10 (down from a 100.), depending on your level in Conjuration:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Less than level 10: max of 1 undead.\n<br />[*] level 10-19: max of 2 undead.\n<br />[*] level 20-29: max of 3 undead.\n<br />[*] level 30-39: max of 4 undead.\n<br />[*] level 40-49: max of 5 undead.\n<br />[*] level 50-59: max of 6 undead.\n<br />[*] level 60-69: max of 7 undead.\n<br />[*] level 70-79: max of 8 undead.\n<br />[*] level 80-89: max of 9 undead.\n<br />[*] level 90 and up: max of 10 undead.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />- Reduced the range of the AoE.\n<br />- Reduced duration of spell to 60 seconds. (down from 200 seconds.)\n<br />- When the effect ends, the raised dead will turn to ash, so they can't be re-raised as undead.   \n<br />\n<br />Note: This stone was broken and way too easily used for exploits. The way the stone is now is still pretty powerful, as no Conjuration spell even allows for 10 raised undead at the same time, and the Ritual Stone power can be acquired at level 1.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Skuldafn - Skip Dragon Priest Exploit Fix[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />At the end of [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Skuldafn]Skuldafn[/url], it was possible to run past the Dragon Priest, [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nahkriin_(creature)]Nahkriin[/url], into Sovngarde, skipping the fight with him completely. The portal to Sovngarde is open by default, so I set it closed as default and added the staff to Nahkriin, so you'll have to kill him to get the staff, in order to open the portal.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Salmon Roe - Rebalanced[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The waterbreathing effect on the [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Salmon_Roe]Salmon Roe[/url] ingredient has a duration of 60, which is 12 times the value of the same effect on other ingredients, while its Fortify Magicka effect only has a duration 5 seconds. (normally 60 seconds).\n<br />\n<br />I changed the Fortify Magicka's duration to 60 seconds and the Waterbreathing's effect duration to 10, which is double than the default value, as I still wanted it to stand out, but not by too much.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Paralysis Fall Exploit Fix[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Adds a condition on the Paralysis alchemy effect, so it will no longer work when falling down.\n<br />\n<br />The following ingredients has the [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Paralyze_(effect)]Paralysis [/url]effect as 1st effect, which makes eating it cause paralysis: [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Netch_Jelly]Netch Jelly[/url], [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Gold_Kanet]Gold Kanet[/url] and [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Corkbulb_Root]Corkbulb Root[/url]. If you eat them while falling down, you can exploit this to receive no falling damage. This fix prevents that from happening.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Torch Sheathing Drawing Sneaking Sprinting Exploit Fixes[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Wielding a torch while sprinting allowed you to have unlimited sprint, by spamming the sprinting button while having a torch out.\n<br />In addition, drawing a weapon/torch while sneaking or sprinting would mess up the speed of sprinting/sneaking.\n<br />\n<br />As such, to prevent these exploits, I made the following tweaks:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] I disabled sprinting and sneaking while wielding a torch.\n<br />[*] When sprinting/sneaking (moving) you can no longer draw or sheathe weapons.\n<br />[*] When sprinting/sneaking (moving) and equiping a torch, this will bring you to a halt and make you exit sprinting/sneaking. (Note: Sometimes the torch may be held strangely after being equipped mid-sprint. Simply re-equip to fix that.)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Food Exploit Fixes[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This module changes the Restore Health/Stamina effect on food, that has a longer duration. The way the stamina effect works, it makes you have an infinite source of stamina.I changed these effects to Regenerate Health/Stamina instead, which just increases your existing health/stamina regenerating.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Sneak Rebalanced[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />In Vanilla, Sneak was heavily overpowered, given birth to the \"stealth archer\" meme. For this reason, I decided to decrease sneak damage, while still being quite powerful, just not as broken as Vanilla.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Sneaking XP AFK[/b]\n<br />\n<br />You no longer get sneak XP for simply sneaking, since that was exploitable through just running in a wall and going AFK. To get XP you'll need to perform sneak attacks.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Significantly decreased base sneak damage[/b]   \n<br />\n<br />[list][*] Crossbow: 2x -&gt; 1.100x\n<br />[*] Bow: 2x -&gt; 1.125x\n<br />[*] Battleaxe: 2x -&gt; 1.300x\n<br />[*] Greatsword: 2x -&gt; 1.400x\n<br />[*] Waraxe: 3x -&gt; 1.600x\n<br />[*] Mace: 3x -&gt; 1.650x\n<br />[*] Sword: 3x -&gt; 1.700x\n<br />[*] Unarmed: 2x -&gt; 1.900x\n<br />[*] Dagger: 3x -&gt; 2.000x\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Changes to perks[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Backstab: [color=#e06666]\"Sneak attacks with one-handed weapons now do six times damage.\"[/color] [b]changed to[/b] \"[color=#93c47d]Sneak attacks with unarmed and one-handed weapons (excluding daggers) deal an additional 25% damage. Sneak attacks with two-handed weapons deal an additional 10% damage.\"[/color]\n<br />[*] Deadly Aim: [color=#e06666]\"Sneak attacks with bows now do three times damage.\"[/color] [b]changed to[/b] [color=#93c47d]\"Sneak attacks with bows deal 20% more damage. Sneak attacks with crossbows deal 10% more damage.\"[/color]\n<br />[*] Assassin's Blade: [color=#e06666]\"Sneak attacks with daggers now do a total of fifteen times normal damage.\"[/color] [b]changed to[/b] [color=#93c47d]\"Sneak attacks with daggers deal 0.5% more damage per level in Sneak. (capped at 100% more damage at level 200 in Sneak)\"[/color] (note: to get level 200 in Sneak, you'll need the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8889]Skill Uncapper[/url], otherwise this perk will be capped at 50% more damage at level 100 in Sneak.)\n<br />[*] Shadow Warrior: [color=#93c47d]added a 60 second cooldown to prevent spamming it.[/color]\n<br />[/list][b]Sneak detection scaling[/b]\n<br />\n<br />At level 100 in Sneak, you were virtually invisible. With this tweak, you'll still be difficult to detect, but not as invisible.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Orc Berserker Racial[/b]\n<br />\n<br />I made the Berserk Orc racial no longer work while sneaking.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Backstab enchantment on Dark Brotherhood gloves[/b]\n<br />\n<br />By default, all Dark Brotherhood gloves double sneak attack damage (100% extra sneak damage). I decreased those, but gave every type of gloves a different amount.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Shrouded Handwraps: 5% extra sneak damage\n<br />[*] Shrouded Gloves: 7.5% extra sneak damage\n<br />[*] Jester's Gloves: 10% extra sneak damage\n<br />[*] Cicero's Gloves: 12% extra sneak damage\n<br />[*] Ancient Shrouded Gloves: 15% extra sneak damage\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Muffle Spell[/b]\n<br />\n<br />This spell was an unlimited source of Illusion XP and a free boost to Sneak effectiveness.\n<br />I have turned it into a concentration based spell, so you will need to be casting it, in order to have an effect.\n<br />I also decreased the XP gained from it.\n<br />The scroll of muffle hasn't been reverted to its original effect, since scrolls cannot have concentration spells. (duration has been decreased to 60 seconds.)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Decreased sneak damage when enemies are searching for you[/b]\n<br />\n<br />If any enemy is searching for you, you will deal 50% less sneak damage.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\n<br />\n<br />This module might be incompatible with several mods, most likely perk mods, but likely others as well.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]No Quest Items on Weapon Racks[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Blocks quest items to be mounted on a weapon rack.\n<br />\n<br />Requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]USSEP[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854]powerofthree's Papyrus Extender[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Block Pickpocketing on Exploitable Targets[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Blocks pickpocketing and reverse-pickpocketing on several scripted NPCs, in order to prevent exploiting getting infinite XP without any risks.\n<br />\n<br />Currently included:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sibbi_Black-Briar]Sibbi Black-Briar[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Astrid]Astrid[/url] (during [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:With_Friends_Like_These...]With Friends Like These...[/url])\n<br />[*] [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fultheim_the_Fearless]Fulltheim the Fearless[/url] (during [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:With_Friends_Like_These...]With Friends Like These...[/url])\n<br />[*] [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alea_Quintus][/url] (during [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:With_Friends_Like_These...]With Friends Like These...[/url])\n<br />[*] [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Vasha]Vasha[/url] (during [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:With_Friends_Like_These...]With Friends Like These...[/url])\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Attacking Friendlies To Get XP Exploit Fix[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Makes certain friendly NPCs aggressive if you attack them, in order to prevent attacking them to get infinite XP.\n<br />\n<br />NPCs covered:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Shadowmere]Shadowmere[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ralof]Ralof[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hadvar]Hadvar[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Greybeards]The 4 Greybeards[/url]\n<br />[*] [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Paarthurnax_(dragon)]Paarthurnax[/url]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Greybeards Immune to Paralysis[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This tweak makes [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Greybeards]the 4 Greybeards[/url] immune to paralysis, to avoid messing up their AI when using Whirlwind Sprint.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]No Jumping While Swimming or Sneaking[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Disables jumping while swimming or sneaking to prevent some animation related exploits.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Jail Armor Stacking Exploit Fix[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Fixes the exploit where armor can be stacked by abusing the jail system. The exploit is exposed [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWGmd9bKWOY]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />After you serve your time, all armor and weapons will be unequipped, except for Ragged Robes and Boots.\n<br />\n<br />Note: You'll need [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230]Engine Fixes[/url] for this, or you might risk a CTD, since UnequipAll() sometimes causes that.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Harmful Utility Spells Deal Damage[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Soul Trap, Paralysis and Raise Undead spells will deal a small amount of damage. This will cause aggro when casting them on friendly targets, to prevent exploiting spam-casting this on friendly targets to gain xp.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]FAQ[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Q: ESPFE?\n<br />A: Yes.\n<br />\n<br />Q: \"Why even \"fix\" these \"exploits\"?\"\n<br />A: \"I thought to share them for people that are interested in them, and requested them. (Yes, people actually did.) If they're not your cup of tea, that's perfectly fine. Just don't download them, and move along silently, please.\"\n<br />\n<br />Q: Why did you release all these tweaks seperate? Can't you just put them in a pack?\n<br />\n<br />A: They used to be in a pack called Andrealphus' Gameplay Tweaks. (which is now named [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27939]Andrealphus' Tweaks - Harder Quests[/url]) \n<br />\n<br />However, since the title wasn't descriptive enough, many people were having issues finding a particular tweak. That mod was just a bag of random things, because I never really thought about packaging it up for the public. I was just playing around with it, releasing them as I made them. However, I want to make all of the tweaks to be easier to find by the public, and as such decided to seperate them and give them better descriptive names.\n<br />For instance, if someone was looking for a mod to feed rabbits, they couldn't find the tweak that I made, since it was part of \"Andrealphus Gameplay Tweaks\". However, now I hope it's easier to find them. My apologies for any inconvenience.\n<br />\n<br />As for a pack. They're all flagged as ESLs, so they don't count towards the plugin limit. You can merge them yourself if you want, but I won't be merging \n<br />them, since it's too cumbersome to keep both a seperate and merged version up, not too mention updating them at that point.\n<br />\n<br />I also won't be putting them into a FOMOD, since that would require to re-upload all of them everytime I make a minor update. My internet is limited unfortunately, with monthly caps, so uploading them all just to make a minor change is quite harmful for me."
