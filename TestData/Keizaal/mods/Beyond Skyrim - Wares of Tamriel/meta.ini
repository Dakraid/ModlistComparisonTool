The only exception is other mods that may have changed the \n<br />area around Dawnstar's harbour. If this is the case, it's recommended to\n<br /> put [i]WoT[/i] lower in your load order but a patch may be required.[b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />INSTALLATION[/b][b]:\n<br />\n<br />Manual:[/b]\n<br />1.
