nexusDescription="[size=4]Got permission from Krucify to port his original mod to Skyrim Special Edition.\n<br />This is different from the one uploaded by nekollx, because this is correctly ported: saved in CK and checked in SSEEdit and merged with some fields of USSEP.\n<br />\n<br />Original mod: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40400/]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40400/[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Description:\n<br />\n<br />All cases have been fixed in all three homes. Does not matter which wing you choose on which house.\n<br />I would recommend getting your weapons out of the ping pong pits before you add this file.\n<br />I am not responsible if the cases gobble up your weapons by not following directions.\n<br />\n<br />Could conflict with other mods that add or change HearthFires homes.\n<br />Load it on top (maybe right after USSEP Patch).\n<br />\n<br />Enjoy[/size]"
