nexusDescription="While building a modlist, I wanted to include [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952]Cities of the North - Dawnstar[/url] for its unique building designs, however it ran into a number of conflicts with item placements for other mods which I used. This resulted in a bit of a rabbit hole, teaching myself how to use the CK in addition to xEdit, and creating a series of patches which I felt others could use. This is my first time uploading something, so please bear with me, and I hope you enjoy. Each mod which has a patch is listed below, with specific details of all changes contained in spoilers. All patches are ESP flagged as ESL, so they will not take up load order space (unless you're at the thousands of patches level). As I'm now moving into maintenance mode, I'm adding which version of the parent mods is the most recent one I've actively taken a look at. If parent mods continue to update further, these patches may not work as intended, or may not do everything they're supposed to do.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Included Patch Descriptions[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194]3DNPCs/Interesting NPCs[/url] - Shifts Theron's spawn and lean marker, as well as a number of other markers for the [url=http://3dnpc.com/wiki/interesting-npcs/quests/darkened-steel/darkened-steel/a-daedra-in-the-dark/cat-and-mouse/deathbroker/a-path-of-bones/]A Path of Bones[/url] quest (link contains quest spoilers). Re-upload of the1yunico's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29141]patch[/url] which only moves Theron's location inside the Windpeak Inn available in the old files section.

Last checked against version 2.1\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654]AI Overhaul SSE[/url] - shifts some placed idle markers to match the new interior/exteriors, forwards removed lean markers. Last checked against version 1.6.7\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/487]Amulets of Skyrim[/url] - Moves five amulets to their appropriate locations in the new interiors. Last checked against version 4.061\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49779]Artifacts of Skyrim - Revised Edition[/url] - Shifts a placed object to match the new interiors. Last checked against version 1.2\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15092]BadGremlin's Collection AIO [/url]- Moves two of the fish to their appropriate locations in the new interiors. Note: Patch is for AIO, not for the Fishys .esp. Last checked against version SE1\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5124]Blowing in the Wind[/url]\xfeff/[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289]JK's Skyrim[/url] - Blowing in the Wind doesn't add objects to Dawnstar, but the JK's Skyrim patch does,\xfeff this allows it to work well with the next exterior. Last checked against version 2.04 of Blowing in the Wind.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41312]Cathedral - 3D Mountain Flowers[/url] - CR for new snowy flowers type. Last checked against version 1.8\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36506]Cheesemod for EVERYONE[/url] - Shifts a few added cheeses to match the new interior. Last checked against version 1.01\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6369]Cloaks of Skyrim[/url] - Moves four placed cloaks to appropriate locations in the new interiors. Last checked against version 1.2.1\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4155]Clockwork[/url] - Moves the trapdoor location to match new exterior. Last checked against version 1.0\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13154]Dawnstar Overhaul[/url] - Combines the changes from Dawnstar Overhaul with COTN Dawnstar. Added buildings retain their look in Dawnstar Overhaul due to lack of appropriate assets. Last checked against version 1.0. Note: parent mod has some deleted vanilla navmeshes, etc - that's not something that can be fixed in a patch.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33965]Denizens of Morthal[/url] - Conflict-resolution patch where a bedroll's ownership is changed. Last checked against version 1.2\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20666]Elder Outfit Overhaul[/url] - Just a load order compatibility patch. Ensures Madena and Frida spawn in their new location if EEO is placed after COTN - Dawnstar. Last checked against version 1.52.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085]Embers XD[/url] - Shifts the placement of fires to better utilize the new look of Embers XD, includes some ashes spread around, and in a few places substitutes fire types to better match aesthetics. Last checked against version 2.4.6.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url] \xfeff- Three patches available. Main patch applies the ELFX lighting/effects to the new interiors as best as I was able, and includes new meshes for the Jarl's Keep/Inn. Old version which just disabled ELFX lights available in old files. ELFX Exteriors patch also included separately. Last checked against version 3.06.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/157]Equippable Tomes [/url]- moves one placed object in Silus's house to appropriate location in the new interior. Last checked against version 1.01\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13552]Expanded Towns and Cities[/url] - applies the COTN aesthetics for interior/exterior for all added houses for ETaC. Patches available for both the Complete and standalone Dawnstar versions, but NSUTR patches only for Complete.\xfeff Last checked against version 0.6.\xa0 WILL NOT WORK WITH VERSION 0.4.4 or earlier. Look in the old versions section for a patch for that version if you need it.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29565]Great Cities/JKs Skyrim [/url]- cleaned and re-done version of BreezyBun's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29565]patch[/url] which allows COTN, The Great City of Dawnstar, and JKs Skyrim to all play well together. Navmesh has been completely redone, effectively, and the JKs - GCoD patch is no longer needed. Last checked against version 2.11 of Great City of Dawnstar\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19491]The Great City of Dawnstar[/url] - standalone patch with The Great City of Dawnstar, without JKs Skyrim as a requirement. Last checked against version 2.11 of Great City of Dawnstar. \n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20272]The Great Cities - Minor Cities and Towns [/url]\xfeff- Patch which applies the same changes as The Great City of Dawnstar patch, but to the AIO version of The Great Cities. Last checked against version 2.01\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22671]Guards Armor Replacer [/url]\xfeff- Shifts placement of a few armor pieces to match the new guards' barracks interior. Last checked against version 5.5a\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5673]Helgen Reborn[/url] - Ensures Sorian and Orianthi spawn inside the new bounds of the Windpeak Inn during their quest. Last checked against version V106.SSE\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1533]Holidays[/url] - Adjusts placement of decorations/fliers in the Inn so they match the new exteriors/interiors. Last checked against version 2.14\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/173]Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul [/url]- designed for version 0.4. Four patches available.\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\x2022 Base patch - forwards updates to objects/markers in various interiors. Moves added markers/objects to new locations to match the new interiors - please note that all changes here are subjective on my part, and may not reflect the vision of the original mod, most notably the cot location and the dancing/celebration markers in the Windpeak Inn. Due to the complete rewrite of the Windpeak Inn, the navmesh changes from COTN - Dawnstar are forwarded to overwrite AI Overhaul's. After re-reading Shurah's message, I realized I could clean up the navmesh if I used his as the base, so I've done so, along with fixing some landscape issues to prevent gaps/grass/etc. The only adjustment to placement of objects/markers was to lower them to match the new landscape. I tested the behavior quite a bit, so no issues should arise, but if any were to do so, bother me, not ICAIO folks - it's definitely something on my end.\n<br />\x2022 3DNPC patch - If using the complete patch for 3DNPC, there is one chair in the Windpeak Inn which is touched by all three mods - this forwards the changes from the previous ones, so they play well together. Include after the base patch. I don't have a version for the \"Interiors Only\" one right now, but will put one together if someone asks - I'm guessing this won't be a very interesting usage case for folks, though :)\n<br />\x2022 JKs Skyrim - No longer requires base patch as a master. Forwards updates to objects/markers in various interiors. Moves added markers/objects to new locations to match the new interiors - please note that all changes here are subjective on my part, and may not reflect the vision of the original mod, most notably the cot location and the dancing/celebration markers in the Windpeak Inn. Due to the complete rewrite of the Windpeak Inn, the navmesh changes from COTN - Dawnstar are forwarded to overwrite AI Overhaul's. After re-reading Shurah's message, I realized I could clean up the navmesh if I used his \n<br />as the base, so I've done so, along with fixing some landscape issues toprevent gaps/grass/etc. The end of JK's dock (and the corresponding scaffold changes) have been removed to prevent clipping with the ferryman campsite. No references/markers with ICAIO have been touched in this case, just adjustment of landscape/navmesh to match (and prevent grass clipping). I tested the behavior quite a bit, so no issues should arise, but if any were to do so, bother me, not ICAIO or JK - it's definitely something on my end.\n<br />\x2022 ra2phoenix's all-in-one patch adjusts the placement of some of the added objects down by the ferry for ICAIO. Its placement conflicts with Arthmoor's Dawnstar by default, and this patch takes care of that. Additionally, it rolls back CFTO changes (CFTO makes a duplicate of NPCs and disables the original ones), and applies the dialogue/etc from CFTO to the vanilla NPC. It's been thoroughly tested and the ferry behavior works, as well as all expected AI behavior of the ferryman from ICAIO is being done properly, without touching any packages or quests. There's already a CFTO-ICAIO patch, but when I tested it out, the ferryman wasn't sandboxing correctly with that patch, so I'm not sure the patch does everything it should do? At least not in Dawnstar. xEdit manipulation would require that patch to work with this one, but given it does not seem to do what the original patch [i]should[/i], I did not want to include it as a master. Specific changes relative to ICAIO are including everything in the base patch, while also moving the campfire/ferryman markers to match new exterior.\n<br />\n<br />There used to be an interiors only patch but it's been removed. It's still available in the old files area.[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/595]Immersive Wenches[/url] - moves a bunch of markers to match the new interiors, primarily sweeping markers in The White Hall. Last checked against version 1.60SE\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/790]Inncredible [/url]- Resolves conflicts so that COTN Dawnstar's interior is the interior usedin Morthal, and Inncredible can be used for other inns. If using Inncredible's 3DNPC patch, load COTN Dawnstar's 3DNPC and Inncredible's patches below it. Last checked against version 1.3.1\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17846]Keep it Clean[/url] - Moves the trapdoor and added towels to a new location within the new interior of the Windpeak Inn. Last checked against version 3.15a\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817]Lanterns of Skyrim II [/url]\xfeff- Two patches available - one for with JKs Skyrim, one without. Only install ONE patch. Special thanks to wizkid for keying me in to what changes were needed for the newly added objects to also toggle with his MCM, confirmed to be working. Last checked against version 2.0.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802]Legacy of the Dragonborn [/url]\xfeff- Moves placed gems/sulfur in every house to match new interior. Moves fliers/drunk marker in Windpeak Inn to match new interior. Moves placed object in Dawnstar Museum to match new interior. Moves three barrels outside the Windpeak Inn to prevent clipping with museum shipping crates, if enabled. Works with/without JKs Skyrim, no other city overhauls tested, but exterior changes are small enough it should work with most any. Last explicitly checked against verison 5.0.&lt;something in the upper 20s&gt; but the changelog has never noted anything which should impact the patch through version 5.2.1\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27622]Medieval Lanterns of Skyrim[/url]/[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289]JKs Skyrim[/url] - this is a REPLACEMENT patch for the MLOS patch on COTN - Dawnstar's page. The JKs Skyrim patch on its page is still needed. Simply put, this fixes two lanterns - one was partially in the geometry in the first patch, and the second lantern was either floating in the air, or the wrong lantern type, depending upon whether the MLOS - JKs patch or the COTN Dawnstar - JKs patch won between their two. This combines both of those edits, along with all the other COTN/MLOS patch edits. I don't know what version that patch was based off of.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22622]More to Say[/url] - just forwarding a persistency/spawn reference point for one NPC. Specifically for the More to Say City Guards patch. Should work with either the merged or the esl-flagged version Last checked against version 5.0.2\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33408]Morskom Estate [/url]\xfeff- resolves a couple conflicts, gets the navmesh/landscape to play with one another. Last checked against version 1.2\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10176]Mystic Condenser[/url] - Fixes placement of the Mystic Condenser put in The White Hall. Last checked against version 2.3\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17026]JKs Skyrim - No Snow Under the Roof [/url]\xfeff- requires the patch at the above link, the NSUTR patch from COTN, and the JKs patch from COTN, all as masters.\xa0 This just makes them all play well with one another, so there shouldn't be any more random floating snow. Last checked against version 1.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11076]Open Civil War[/url] - Moves a set stage trigger back over the opening of The White Hall entrance, matching the new layout. Patch was generated for revision 2.6.1 of OCW, looks good for 2.6.3\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8445]Outlaws Refuges[/url] - slight shift of the trapdoor to the Dawnstar refuge to match new exterior. Alternative version to tie into the JKs/Arthmoor's navmesh provided by ra2phoenix. Last checked against version 1.2.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24859]Perseids Inns and Taverns - Realistic Room Rental [/url]\xfeff- Lets COTN Dawnstar win all conflicts with RRR, but places two interactive mead barrels and the wash basin which are part of RRR (and scripts reference) into the new interior. Load order matters here, due to compatibility patches which conflict with one another. Load COTN/RRR in any order relative to one another, then all RRR patches, then the COTN - RRR patch, and finally all other COTN compatibility patches. Behavior will be potentially erratic otherwise. Last checked against version 1.8.9.001.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2005]Populated Cities and Towns[/url] - Updates location of some markers to match new interiors. Last checked against version 4.1\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22472]Skyrim Artwork Imports [/url]\xfeff- Moves any needed objects placed to match the new interiors. In a few cases where no good locations could be found, disabled the added objects. Last checked against version 1.0\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22374]Skyrim Reputation[/url] - Just a load order compatibility patch. Ensures Frida and Silus spawn in their new location if Skyrim Reputation is placed after COTN - Dawnstar. Same edit for Frida as the EEO patch, order between the two does not matter. Last checked against version 2.4\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5261]Skyrim's Unique Treasures[/url] - Fixes placement for four of the five added items around town (the fifth should not need any fix). Last checked against version 4.4.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680]Skyrim Immersive Creatures[/url] - Fixes placement for one added book inside of Silus's house. Last checked against version 6.6a\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2414]Snazzy Furniture and Clutter Overhaul[/url] - Moves objects/forwards changes to match the new interiors. Additionally, new version of it applies the same SFCO changes to any new references added in the White Hall, and tweaks positioning to match. Last checked against version 1.7.\n<br />\n<br />Staff of Sheogorath - Creation Club. Shifts the note/markers/etc to inside the new inn interior\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42069]Thieves Night on the Town[/url] - There's a COTN Dawnstar patch on the page already, this patch is just for the JK's Skyrim patch, which applies the same settings to the new layout in the added JK's store. Thanks to MissileMann for the patch. Last checked against version 1.0.2\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41198]Thrones of Skyrim[/url] - Created for use with, but does not require Thrones of Skyrim. Adds a small dais under the throne in the White Hall, and shifts a few things in the banquet table to match the new layout. Navmesh is untouched, and probably should be, but all NPCs seemed to route just fine behind the table so I figured better to leave well enough alone.\n<br />\n<br />Vigil Enforcer - Creation Club. Shifts a note, a few NPC spawns, and a few markers to match new interior/exterior, CR on a new bench\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506]Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim[/url] - Shifts a trigger box in Silus's house to match the new interior. Last checked against version 3.1.6.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Other patches I'm aware of: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46359]Distinct Interiors[/url]\xfeff, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42423?]Immersive Laundry[/url] (older, worse, versions of these patches available in the old files section)\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Installation[/i][/size]\n<br />Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into your Skyrim data folder.
