You have been warned :)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4][b][u]Description[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]This is my attempt to make the horses in the game stand out from each other a bit. The different horses you can buy all have a different body type and colour, so the Solitude horse is a chestnut colour, and is very tall, whereas the Markarth horse is a tiny little pony with a short mane. I wanted there to be more reason different horses from different stables and this is the beginning of that transformation for me&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4][u][b]The Different Horses[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]The horses in this mod take their meshes and textures from.....\r<br />\r<br />Fierymarigold&#39;s collection of horse mods - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3253645/?tb=mods&pUp=1\r<br />KrittaKitty&#39;s realistic primative horse breeds - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57456/?\r<br /> \r<br />So if you recognise some features that&#39;s why&#33; So in Size order....\r<br />\r<br />[b]Solitude - [/b]Uses the haflinger coat colour and is the tallest horse you&#39;ll find. With a slim lean build meant for speed you can imagine the nobles of the capital parading around, comparing and showing off their steeds.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Whiterun[/b] - Uses the black fell pony coat and is the next tallest horse, not far off from vanilla. Has feathers (Hairy feet) like the vanilla draft horse but is slimmer like the solitude horse. The perfect horse for adventurers having some of the power of a heavy horse and some of the speed from a light horse. And it&#39;s black. Black is cool. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Windhelm[/b] - Uses the exmoor pony coat and uses the same build as the vanilla horse. This heavy built horse was meant for Skyrim&#39;s harsh climate and is seen pulling the big carts across the holds. This horse also makes and excellent war horse due to its heavy build and resilient nature.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Riften[/b] - Uses the grey fell pony coat and is smaller again than the previous horses. Built similar to the Whiterun horse with a shorter mane thieves prefer this nimble little pony as it\x2019s small enough to be easy to hide. Like in a bush. Or behind a rock. Or up a tree.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Markarth[/b] - Uses the fjord coat and is the smallest horse you\x2019ll find. With a very short mane and a slim build this plucky little pony is born and bred for navigating the rugged hills of The Reach. Well I say a pony, it could be a goat. We should get it one of those little bells. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u][b]Unique Horses[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Frost[/b] - said to be bred from a horse of legend. A tall and elegant horse his coat is pure white like skyrim\x2019s coldest mountains, and has a long flowing mane and tail. He also has a unique and rather comfortable looking frosty blue saddle. Despite all the adventures you may travel together he always stays shiny, pearly, in your face, glaring white\x2026.. Must be magic\x2026..\r<br />\r<br />[b]Shadowmere[/b] - demon horse of the dark brotherhood. A huge heavy built tank of a horse, jet black with red eyes and a saddle showing off her heritage. If you met this horse and its rider on the road chances are you\x2019\x64 give them a wide berth, if they don\x2019t catch you that is\x2026.. [/size]\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][u][b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]How to install[/size][/b][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]It installs just the same as any other mod. If you&#39;re not sure how to install mods then follow the instructions below.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Requirements[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />You don&#39;t need to install anything extra for this mod&#33; Other than a copy of the game and the latest update of course :)\xa0 Everything you need comes in the download. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]To use nexus mod manager[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />1. Click on the files tab above the description\r<br />&gt;2. Click on \x201c\x64ownload with manager\x201d\r<br />3. NMM will open and download the file for you. When it\x2019s finished downloading it will appear in the \x201cmods\x201d tab. Just click to highlight it and then click the button on the left that says \x201c\x61\x63tivates the selected mod\x201d when you hover the mouse over it.\r<br />4. You\x2019ll then see it appear in the \x201cplugins\x201d tab, just make sure the box next to it is ticked and you&#39;re ready to go&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Manual[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />1. Click on the files tab above the description\r<br />2. Click \x201c\x64ownload manually\x201d and select one of the servers and the mod will download.\r<br />3. Now go to your Skyrim data folder. Usually this looks something like C: &gt; program files &gt; steam &gt; steamapps &gt; common &gt; skyrim &gt; data.\r<br />4. The zip folder you downloaded will have the file path but if you&#39;re not sure it should look like this - Skyrim &gt; data &gt; textures &gt; actors &gt; unique horses\r<br />5. Just pop the files there and you&#39;re good to go&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][color=#1e84cc][u][b][size=4]Compatiblity[/size][/b][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]It is compatiple with convienient horses since you all keep asking :) it should be compatiple with anything so long as it&#39;s not also changing the textures, meshes and sizes of horses as that is what this mod does. \r<br />\r<br />ALWAYS LOAD IT LAST IN YOUR LOAD ORDER and it will overwrite anything that changes the same things this mod does. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4][u][b]To-Do List[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=3]Firstly Shadowmere\x2019s texture needs some work on the lower legs. In screenshots and on the video you\x2019ll notice the \x201c\x63oarse hair\x201d compared to the now kinda ghostly \x201cmeh hair\x201d. Truth it I lost a lot of files from the mod a long time ago and have only recently recovered them, and this is the closest I could get to fixing transparency on Fireymarigold\x2019s original mesh. Just imagine she has demon ghost feet for now lol [/size]\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />[/size][*][size=3]Giving horse different stats is a must really, I know how to do it but it will take some experimenting till I\x2019m happy with it. [/size]\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />[/size][*][size=3]Different prices is also something I want to look at like in oblivion, this will be based on stats when I get around to doing them. [/size]\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />[/size][*][size=3]An mcm would be very nice with different texture options but scripting is beyond me. That will take afew days of free time for me to suss out. If anyone can point me in the direction of an idiots guide I\x2019\x64 be very grateful.[/size]\r<br />[/list][color=#1e84cc][size=4][u][b]Credits and Thank yous&#33;[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Fierymarigold[/b] - For permissions to use her amazing horse meshes&#33; Her swift steed stables mod adds a huge variety of horses for you to buy so go check it out&#33; \r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49727/?\r<br />\r<br />[b]Krittakitty[/b] - For permissions to use the Realistic Primitive Horse Breed textures that fit this mod so perfectly&#33; \r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57456/?\r<br />\r<br />[b]wrig675/Bellyache[/b] - for permissions to use some awesome saddle textures that have been in my load order for years.\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/84873/?tb=mods&pUp=1 \xa0\r<br />\r<br />Thank you guys&#33;&#33;&#33; &#92;o/ \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4][u][b]Check out my other mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u][/size][/color][size=3]Dream&#39;s Unique Dogs -\xa0[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56793/?
