nexusDescription="If you ever hated followers and summoned creatures for triggering traps, getting both of you into a tight situation or you were trying to guide them around the pressure plates, then this mod is for you.\r<br />This mod changes few base scripts and as a result your followers and summoned creatures should no longer trigger bear traps, pressure plates and trip wires.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />- Works with all followers and summoned creatures, even those from other mods.\r<br />- Works with all deadly trap mods.\r<br />- Conflicts with other mods if they change the same scripts (TrapTriggerBase and TrapBear scripts).\r<br />- Followers and summoned creatures might trigger traps from other mods if custom trap scripts are used by the author.\r<br />\r<br />How to do a quick test to see if mod is working for you:\r<br />1. Make sure you can conjure a creature or have current follower ID selected in console.\r<br />2. Type in console (coc warehousetraps) which will get you to a cell with many traps.\r<br />3. Summon your creature or bring selected follower by typing in console (moveto player).\r<br />4. Proceed with testing."
