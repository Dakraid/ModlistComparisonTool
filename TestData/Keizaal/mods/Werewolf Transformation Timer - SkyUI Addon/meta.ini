nexusDescription="This mod adds a new icon and timer when the player enters beast form that shows how long is left in the current transformation. There are 4 different icon presets you can choose from, and you can customize the widget's size, transparency, location, and the text's color and size using the mod's MCM. \n<br />One of the presets for the icon matches the coloring used in ElSopa's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23897]Colored SkyUI Active Effect Icons SE[/url]\xfeff so that users of that mod can color match if they wish.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod is verified compatible with Growl, Moonlight Tales, and Manbeast. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Known Issues:\n<br />When first installing on an in-progress playthrough, the widget might not show on the first transformation. The fix is to make a new save and then load it. Everything else should work fine.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />The SkyUI team for their hard work making mods like mine possible\n<br />My artist who helped me color/design the different icons\n<br />ElSopa for his color choices used in that icon\n<br />My modding friends for helping me get set up with SkyUI modding and helping me get this mod working"
