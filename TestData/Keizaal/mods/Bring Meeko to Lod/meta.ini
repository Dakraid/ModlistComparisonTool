As /u/Chillocks pointed out: \"Lod wants a dog and Meeko wants an owner. Seems like a perfect pair.\"\n<br />\n<br />There are some requirements for the dialogue to show up: \n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Meeko must be following the player and be close to him/her.\n<br />[*]The player must have at least agreed to Lod about catching the dog outside Falkreath. (given the fresh meat)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[u]Known issue[/u]: If you give Meeko to Lod, the message will pop up: \"Your pet returns home.\" This is hardcoded as far as know and happens when a pet follower is dismissed. Which is required to make Meeko follow Lod instead.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Patches[/u]: There's a patch in the optional downloads for my other mod called [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23886]How Hard Is This Persuasion Check[/url]. Load the patch after both mods.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Troubleshooting[/u]\n<br />\n<br />If you [color=#ffd966]already[/color] have [color=#ffd966]done[/color] the [color=#f9cb9c]Clavicus Vile Deadric quest[/color], but still want to bring Meeko to Lod, you can use the console command: [color=#9fc5e8]set PlayerKnowsLodWantsADog to 1[/color]. Also make sure Meeko is near you when talking to Lod. This will make sure the dialogue option will be available.\n<br />\n<br />If you use any follower mods, like [color=#ffd966]AFT[/color], you might need to dismiss Meeko, in order to stay at Lod's, after you told Lod to have him.\n<br />\n<br />Both the main ESP and the optional patch have been flagged as an ESLs, so they won't take up an ESP slot in your load order."
