nexusDescription="While playing Anniversary Edition, I found that the creation club horse armor adds in a new dialogue option when speaking to blacksmiths that allows the player to purchase armor for their horse. I felt that this extra dialogue option for every single blacksmith in the game cluttered up the interface unnecessarily. The workers at the stables will already sell horse armor to the player; blacksmiths selling horse armor feels needlessly redundant. This mod removes the option from blacksmiths so that only stable workers will offer horse armor.\n<br />\n<br />In my opinion, it makes more sense for the horse stables to act as your one place for everything horse related. Even if you purchase armor from a blacksmith, you still need to ask a horse stable worker to fit it onto your horse. The horse stable workers charge a fee to fit armor which means that using a blacksmith to purchase it adds extra steps and cost for no tangible benefit.\n<br />\n<br />This is a simple mod made with SSEEdit that makes it so that the game doesn't attempt to add the horse armor dialogue option to NPCs assigned to the blacksmith faction."
