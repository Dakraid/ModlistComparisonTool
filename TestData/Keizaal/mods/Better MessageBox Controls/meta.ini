Use Left/Right controls, and Activate to select options (typically A,D and E but it should work if you remapped those controls to other keys). Fixes the clickable area of buttons so they are easier to click.\n<br />\n<br />[center]\n<br />Reviewed by Brodual at [url=http://www.youtube.com/user/Brodual?feature=watch]Daily Skyrim Mod Spotlight[/url][color=#313131]________ ________[/color]Reviewed by olivierhacking at [url=http://www.youtube.com/user/olivierhacking?feature=watch]Skyrim Mod Reviews[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]8yj9TDTrB10[/youtube][color=#313131]......[/color][youtube]_1uLHwLkkKo[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffc000]Detailed Changes[/color][/size]\n<br />These are the changes made to the vanilla (original) Skyrim message boxes:\n<br />\n<br />[list][*]Enabled the gamepad style controls, which lets you navigate between options with the [color=#00b050]Left/Right keys[/color] (usually WASD), and select an option with the [color=#00b050]Activate key[/color] (usually E) and [color=#00b050]Return/Enter keys[/color]. Now you can dismiss simple \x201cOk\x201d message boxes by pressing a single key instead of being forced to click a tiny text label.\n<br />[*]The [color=#00b050]TAB key[/color] cycles through \"Exit\" type buttons, where the label matches exactly \"Return\", \"Exit\", \"Done\", \"Cancel\", \"Back\" or \"No\". This helps navigate custom menus from mods that have lots of options. While SkyUI3/MCM will alleviate this, there are still many instances where mods will continue to use message boxes (or mods that won\x2019t update to use MCM).\n<br />[*][color=#f6b26b][i]With SKSE enabled[/i][/color] pressing [color=#00b050]ESCAPE[/color] picks the first \x201c\x65xit\x201d button and selects it. Thus you can quickly exit out of most dialogs that provide an \x201c\x65xit\x201d button. The recognized \x201c\x65xit\x201d buttons are exactly as for the TAB key (see above). You can quickly exit out of Yes/No dialogs, and mod options. In multi level mod options usually the ESCAPE key will take you to the parent set of options, because it picks \x201cReturn\x201d, \x201c\x42\x61\x63k\x201d or \x201c\x43\x61ncel\x201d, etc. [color=#f6b26b][i]WITHOUT SKSE[/i][/color] the ESCAPE key behaves exactly as the TAB key (I\x2019m sorry but it was not possible otherwise to distinguish the keys as crazy as it sounds!).\n<br />[*]Fixed the width of the clickable area for the buttons to properly adapt to the entire length of the button label.\n<br />[*]Extended the clickable area also below the button labels, instead of only above. This makes them easier to pick with the mouse.\n<br />[*]Added a subtle highlight to the focused button.\n<br />[/list] \n<br />[size=3][color=#ffc000]For XBox Controller/Gamepad Users[/color][/size]\n<br />This mod may also be of interest to gamepad users: when you configure mods like Shooting Stars or Convenient Horses, instead of pressing Right multiple times to select \"Return\" or \"Exit\", which gets tedious, you can simply press [color=#00b050][b]( B )[/b][/color] to jump to the next \x201c\x65xit\x201d option (buttons labelled \x201c\x45xit\x201d, \x201cReturn\x201d, \x201c\x43\x61ncel\x201d and \x201c\x42\x61\x63k\x201d) and then press [color=#00b050][b]( A )[/b][/color] to select. Likewise when exiting out of a \"sub menu\" pressing [color=#00b050][b]( B ) &gt; ( A )[/b][/color] quickly goes back to the parent menu.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffc000]Further Thoughts[/color][/size]\n<br />On my computer there is a noticable lag on the mouse input in the menus despite FRAPS showing 60 FPS. This lag makes it awkward to accurately click on tiny areas. So improving the clickable area of buttons is a worthwhile usability fix as far as I\x2019m concerned.\n<br />\n<br />Enabling Left/Right/Activate keyboard controls was pretty much flipping a switch in the code. The TAB key then would simply cycle through all buttons, duplicating what the \x201cRight\x201d key does. So I changed its behaviour as described above to make it a bit more interesting and useful.\n<br />\n<br />Lastly regarding the buggy clickable areas, to be fair it\x2019s not much of an issue in vanilla Skyrim, because most button labels will be short like \x201cYes\x201d, \x201cNo\x201d or \x201cOk\x201d. But with mods it is quite common for the button labels to become longer, exposing this bug.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffc000]Game &amp; Mod Compatibility[/color][/size]\n<br />- Works with [color=#b6d7a8]Skyrim Special Edition[/color].\n<br />- Tested with Skyrim [color=#b6d7a8]v1.8[/color] (this mod should work on older versions but it has not been tested).\n<br />- This mod is purely a [color=#b6d7a8][i]user interface mod[/i][/color]. It\x2019s essentially Flash (Scaleform) technology used by the game to display menus. It runs in a sandbox pretty much, and as such can not cause incompatibilities with [color=#b6d7a8][i]gameplay mods[/i][/color] that affect quests, items and such; even if you have hundreds of these mods active.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffc000]Install / Uninstall[/color][/size]\n<br />Activating or deactivating this interface mod does not affect your savegames at all. It does [u]not[/u] use SKSE. The load order should not matter either.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installing[/b]\n<br />Use Wrye Bash, or Nexus Mod Manager. It\x2019s just one file so you can also unzip the archive and place the file in your Skyrim/Data/Interface folder.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Uninstalling[/b]\n<br />Simply delete the file, or rename it to \x201c_messagebox.swf\x201d (for example) to disable it temporarily.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/hXQSy.png[/img][/url][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffc000]Change Log[/color][/size]\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Version 1.2[/color][/b]\n<br />[list][*]Added the ESCAPE key functionality (see updated features list).\n<br />[*]Added \"Done\" to the list of exit buttons recognized by the TAB and ESCAPE keys, as in eg. Forgotten Mastery mod (thanks assterixxx).\n<br />[*]Includes a function necessary for compatiblity with future mod(s). This code is otherwise dormant and has no performance impact.\n<br />[/list][b][color=#b6d7a8]Version 1.1[/color][/b] - This update fixes an issue where the focus was not always shown on the first button (ie. Disenchant confirmation \"Ok\" button). This update has been tested with both keyboard and gamepad. Thanks to 3012 and assterixxx for reports.\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Version 1.0[/color][/b] - First release.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffc000]Related Mods[/color][/size]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1721/?]Ultrawide Interface[/url] by InAComaDial999  includes Better Dialogue Controls and Better MessageBox Controls (modified for 21:9 ultra wide) on the SSE nexus.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffc000]Source Code[/color][/size]\n<br />See [url=https://github.com/fabd/skyrimui/commits/BetterMsgboxControls]BetterMsgboxControls[/url] branch, which is in my fork of [url=https://github.com/Mardoxx/skyrimui]Mardoxx/skyrimui[/url] on Github.
