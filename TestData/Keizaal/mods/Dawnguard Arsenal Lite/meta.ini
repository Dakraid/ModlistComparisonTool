Affected targets will flee in terror at the divinely blessed onslaught when hit.\xa0 It'll be available at the same time as Expert-level Restoration spells.\n<br />\n<br />* Existing sun damage sound effects have been adjusted to be more appropriate.\n<br />\n<br />* Several Dawnguard members have been uprated:\n<br />** Isran should now sport proper heavy armor, and his warhammer has been replaced with a new Greatsword.\n<br />** Sorine should now start with a Dwarven (standard) Crossbow and some steel bolts.\n<br />** Gunmar should now have a Dawnguard Battlehammer once he joins up.\n<br />** Florentius will now have robes that don't clip with his armored boots/gauntlets, and will get rid of his junky iron sword for a Dawnguard sword. He's also sporting a repertoire of Sun damage spells.\n<br />** Many other less prominent members have had armament switcheroos as well.\n<br />** Ideally, these will work with a New Game.\xa0 However, I have made a retroactive script that should effect these changes as well.\xa0 Much of the aspects on the NPCs in question that I altered may be baked in data in the save.\n<br />\n<br />* Dawnguard armor only now requires the body, gauntlets, and boots to gain the Dawnguard vampire-resistive set bonus.\xa0 \n<br />\n<br />DAWNGUARD ARSENAL SSE IMPROVEMENTS:\n<br />* Blade texture sets now have a higher-res normal map. Packed DXT5 because BC7 did different kinds of compression artifacting that were more noticeable than DXT5's.\n<br />* De-LARP-ified 1H Dawnguard Axe now included. Should I ever release my old De-LARP-ification mod, then just let this or the other overwrite each other because they'll be identical.\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/25094/25094-1555445445-1916216484.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Unpack the ESP module and BSA archive into your Skyrim Special Edition/Data folder and activate.\xa0 If you use the latest version of Ars Metallica, it is strongly suggested to use the compatibility patch, have Dawnguard Arsenal load after Ars Metallica, and the patch load after both.\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/25094/25094-1555445461-1238508735.png[/img]\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />v 1.0:\n<br />First release.\n<br />\n<br />REFER TO OLDRIM DAWNGUARD ARSENAL FOR PREVIOUS CHANGE LOG: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72910/]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72910/\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/25094/25094-1555445483-1172621536.png[/img]\n<br />Sovngarde font (used in description page imagery) by MistValkyrie: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/386]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/386[/url]\n<br />[size=3]Leather texture by Tsabo6 (Alexander Nanitchkov): [url=http://www.deviantart.com/art/Leather-texture-82368154]http://www.deviantart.com/art/Leather-texture-82368154[/url]\n<br />Metal texture by Nobiax: [url=http://nobiax.deviantart.com/art/Commission-Medieval-textures-406572548]http://nobiax.deviantart.com/art/Commission-Medieval-textures-406572548[/url]\n<br />Ars Metallica by Arthmoor, compatibility patch made with permission: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/321]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/321\n<br />[/url][/size]"
