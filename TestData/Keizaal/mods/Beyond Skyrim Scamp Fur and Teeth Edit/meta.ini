nexusDescription="This is quick retexture job I did for myself to fix some issues I personally had with Beyond Skyrim's scamp design. While I think it's mostly great, the tufts of hair on the arms and back never seemed to layer naturally and the teeth reminded me of candy corn for some reason. So, I removed the fur and darkened and desaturated the teeth to blend better with the rest of the model. I figured someone else out there might have the same opinion and decided to share my work."
