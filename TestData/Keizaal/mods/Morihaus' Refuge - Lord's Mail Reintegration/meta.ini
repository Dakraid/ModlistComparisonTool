nexusDescription="[center][b][color=#ea9999]What does this mod do?[/color][/b][/center]\n<br />I like the Lord's Mail model, and have previously released a retexture to bring the textures to my preference too, however, I was still not happy with the way the artifact was obtained in game. While the quest that was written is not bad, it does suffer from a lack of voiced dialogue, particularly with respect to starting the quest in the first place.\n<br />\n<br />Out of this wish to have a better method of integration, I have created Morihaus' Refuge, a dungeon mod that also serves as a way to integrate the Lord's Mail creation differently. If you decide this mod is for you, you can expect the following:\n<br />- The quest involving Redguard thieves has been completely removed.\n<br />- A new dungeon, amongst some Ancient Imperial ruins.\n<br />- A moderately challenging boss who will use the full force of both their armor and their weapon against you. The Lord's Mail has been made functional for this boss, so beware its health draining effects.\n<br />\n<br />The Redguard clothes also included in the Lord's Mail Creation have been added to clothing lists as they are in the original creation.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ea9999][b][center]Requirements[/center][/b][/color]\n<br />For now, this dungeon is based on being located in Bruma to ensure that it will not conflict with other mods that may add dungeons, however, it is possible I may look at making an alternative at a later date.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ea9999][center][b]Credits[/b][/center][/color]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2931683]RonnieMagnum[/url] - For the Ancient Imperial tileset (from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23438]Fort Castellum[/url]) that was retextured to create the ruins in this mod.\n<br />Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil - for making [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917]Beyond Skyrim - Bruma[/url], and the POI on which this mod's Bruma version is based.\n<br />Viltuska for the Minotaur assets, included in both Beyond Skyrim - Bruma, but also as a model resource from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16918]Hunt of Hircine[/url], from which the non Bruma version is derived."
