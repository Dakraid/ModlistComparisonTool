nexusDescription="So you&#39;ve trekked through miles of dwemer hall, fought your way pass their soul-powered automatons (they&#39;re not soul powered you&#39;re just dumb and think that), and finally, finally received your reward. The amazing and beautiful helm, the Visage of Mzu- oh wait this thing just has the vanilla model because Bethesda was too busy to even so much as give it a different color and are leaving it to Trainwiz to fix.\xa0\r<br />Well you know what, that&#39;s just fine.\xa0\r<br />\r<br />As the name suggests, this here masterpiece will replace the Visage of Mzund&#39;s model with something more appropriate and centurion oriented given that it has stats above that of an artifact.\xa0\r<br />Will conflict with anything that changes the Visage of Mzund, because HELLO OF COURSE IT MODIFIES THAT HELMET.\r<br />Texture replacers that replace steam centurion textures will affect it."
