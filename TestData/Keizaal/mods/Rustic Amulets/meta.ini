nexusDescription="[size=4][b]RUSTIC AMULETS - Special Edition[/b] \xa0is a retexture of the amulets found in Skyrim, including the ones from the Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLCs. This is a lore-friendly retexture that's meant to do justice to the original designs. There was nothing wrong with the original designs in concept, they just suffered from low resolution and sloppy execution.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/headers/102624_1588380081.jpg[/img][size=4]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#a4c2f4]UPDATE 2.0:[/color][/b] I've added retextures for two unique rings, the ring of Hircine, and the ring of Namira. Both were a blurry mesh in their original form, so they were crying out for some attention. I hope people like the end result.\n<br />\n<br />My intent was to make this retexture mod as lore-friendly as possible. I didn't want to reinvent the amulets, only to try to better realize the original design concepts, making them more detailed and defined. The only real embellishment I indulged in was adding some semi-precious and precious gemstones to make them a little more special in appearance. I didn't believe the nine divines would mind.\n<br />\n<br />\xfeffThere was one amulet texture in particular that always bothered me, and that's the necromancer amulet. That goofy skull was just an abomination to me, so I decided I had to do something about it. That task led me to eventually decide to redo all the amulets, since they all really needed it, in my opinion.\n<br />\n<br />The original amulet textures for the Skyrim were too small from the start, and sadly they weren't well drawn for the most part. Some are frankly embarrassingly crude. Despite being small in-game objects, the amulets are also let down by the poor meshes. They are low-poly and blocky in appearance, which make the already low-res textures look even more blurry. The worst of both worlds.\n<br />\n<br />\xfeffIn order to add enough detail to improve the\xa0\x61mulets visually, I decided 1K was the best size to balance\xa0\x61ppearance with performance. For such small objects, anything larger isn't\xa0necessary and would add unneeded VRAM load.\n<br />\n<br />It would be nice if someday an intrepid modder took it upon themself to improve the amulet meshes. They are really crying out for\xa0\x61 decent high-poly makeover. But, until then, I did my best to\xa0improve their appearance with a simple texture overhaul.\n<br />\n<br />For the standard amulets, I recommend using Saerileth's [color=#00ffff][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4294]Gemling Queen Jewelry\xa0SE[/url]\xfeff[/color] mod which I provided textures for. This mod greatly improves the standard amulet mesh and adds refracting gemstones which makes them very life-like in appearance.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3]I hope people enjoy my latest addition to my RUSTIC mod series of retextures for Skyrim. Happy gaming!\n<br />\n<br />Cheers,\n<br />Gamwich\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/102624/102624-1588383972-209940622.jpeg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/102624/102624-1588383990-1122403925.jpeg[/img]"
