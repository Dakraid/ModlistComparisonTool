The game recycles, resets, and respawns generic NPCs. Only persistent NPCs are stored. Some NPCs are marked by the game as persistent because they are important for quests or other functions. The MCM is there so you can undo actions that might otherwise make a quest impossible to complete.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Some buried NPC is no longer tracked in MCM after a few days\n<br />A: Some NPCs have a dead body clean up script attached to them that moves them to the [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Test_Cells#.5BUnnamed_Cell.5D_4]WIDeadBodyCleanupCell[/url]\xfeff a few days after they die. When this happens, this mod's MCM no longer tracks them.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Can you add a headstone, burial urns, and similar objects when you bury someone?\n<br />A: No. This mod's purpose is to clean things up, not to replace the body with more clutter.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is this ESL?\n<br />A: See mod description.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Can install this mod in the middle of my playthrough?\n<br />A: See mod description.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is it safe upgrade?\n<br />A: See mod description.\n<br />\n<br />Q: What's the difference between this mod and some other mod?\n<br />A: That information is probably in the mod description of this mod and the other mod.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Compatible with random mod?\n<br />A: Yes.\n<br />\n<br />Q: I am dumb, and I buried some body needed for quest!\n<br />A: Use MCM to bring the body back\n<br />\n<br />Q: I am stuck in the animation!\n<br />A: You set the burial duration too low, so the animation got confused. Just jump to get unstuck.\n<br />\n<br />Q: How can I bury bodies in stone/wood/whatever the floor is made out of?\n<br />A: Skyrim is actually a video game, an abstract representation of a fantasy world, an approximate facsimile of a fictional reality. There are actually no floors in this game, what you see are merely 2d textures stretched over 3d polygons. These bodies aren't truly being \"buried,\" they are simply teleported to a separate location for processing, and the action your player character performs isn't actually shoveling dirt, but merely playing a shoveling animation.[/quote]"
