nexusDescription="Very quick mod I've just whipped up, makes Beyond Skyrim uses 4thUknown's Scamps without changing any stats or animations, so they still use Falmer animations and attacks.\n<br />If there are any other mods using BS's Scamps that you would like me to create a patch for, let me know.\n<br />This mod works by making the Scamps use a custom skeleton, a Falmer skeleton with the proportions of a Riekling.\n<br />Feel free to use this skeleton to make any other creature that uses Riekling animations use Falmer animations instead, such as giving the Rieklings swords and shields or letting them use magic. Just give me credit.\n<br />The only mod you're not allowed to make with this skeleton is one to replace the BS Goblins with CC Goblins (including any mods that use the BS goblins that aren't BS itself), as I am already making that mod myself.\n<br />\n<br />Now has an option to make the Scamps in 4thUnknown's mod use Falmer animations and Flames, doesn't require Beyond Skyrim - let it overwrite 4thUnknown's esp.\n<br />\n<br />Requires\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44505?tab=posts]Scamps by 4thUnknown[/url]\xfeff (only the models and textures, the esp can be deleted or disabled\xa0if you so wish) and\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917]Beyond Skyrim - Bruma by the Beyond Skyrim Team[/url]."
