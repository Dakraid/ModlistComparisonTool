[/spoiler]\n<br />[b]It's also worth mentioning[/b] that this mod mostly operates by detecting and enforcing animation events, not by equipping and unequipping your current ammo, so this means that \"the last shot bug\" will not be present and your silver bolts will do a proper damage against undead!\n<br />\n<br />[b][center][color=#1e84cc][size=3]INSTALLATION &amp; COMPATIBILITY[/size][/color][/center][/b]\n<br />To install simply copy esp and Scripts folder in [game folder]&#92;Data and enable esp file in game options.\n<br />Meshes folder actually optional but recommended, since it fixes some vanilla bugs with dwarven xbow reload animations (no sound in 3rd person with quick shot perk and incorrect 1st person sneak reload animation), you can skip installing meshes if you use interfering animation mod.\n<br />\n<br />If you are using Requiem, you must install additional patch from downloads page, otherwise heavy and light crossbows will have same reload speed and Rapid Reload perk will do nothing. \n<br />Patch is built on 1.9.4 version, but should be compatible with 2.x/3.x and most likely will remain compatible with future versions.\n<br />\n<br />Do it backwards to uninstall, but make sure to only delete this mod's files from Scripts and Meshes folders.\n<br />If you're removing this mod's files on existing save, it may be good idea to type \"stopquest hznecrquest\" in console and save in a new slot before removal.\n<br />\n<br />This mod changes very few vanilla records and files and does most of its changes by a script so it should be pretty compatible with anything.\n<br />\n<br />Obviously incompatible with other manual crossbow reloading mods.\n<br />Probably incompatible with \"multishot\" crossbow mods.\n<br />May be incompatible with some weapon animation mods if they change key events (unlikely).\n<br />\n<br />Load order: not very important, but better place it after sound overhauls and mods that change CK animation records. \n<br />If you're experiencing problems, try to move NECR lower.\n<br />[b][center][color=#1e84cc][size=3]CREDITS &amp; PERMISSIONS[/size][/color][/center][/b]\n<br />aitch-zed (former HeroinZero)\n<br />ttwatsselfs@gmail.com\n<br />\n<br />You can use this mod or parts of it for whatever you want as long as you're not selling it and as long as you credit me in a readme."
