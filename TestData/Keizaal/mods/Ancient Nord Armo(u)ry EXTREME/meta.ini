nexusDescription="[b][i]HELLO YOU.[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Are you [color=#ff0000][b]ANNOYED [/b][/color]that the male and female variants of the Ancient Nord Armo(u)r are vastly different from each other?\n<br />Are you [b][color=#ff0000]DISGUSTED [/color][/b]that there is a schism in the community over whether or not Ancient Nord Armo(u)r is light or heavy?\n<br />Are you [color=#ff0000][b]RILED [/b][/color]that there is no Nord Hero Armo(u)r to compliment the Nord Hero Weapons?\n<br />Are you [color=#ff0000][b]RATHER QUITE ANGRY[/b][/color] that the Ancient Nord Armo(u)r is a rarity in the game and the ability to craft said low-level armo(u)r is given to you at the end of the Companions questline?\n<br />\n<br />If yes, then [i][b][color=#ff0000]ANCIENT NORD ARMO(U)RY EXTREME[/color][/b][/i] is certainly the mod...\n<br />[center][url=https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/105021/105021-1602365975-1213986962.png]\xfeff[/url]\xfeff[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/105021/105021-1602365975-1213986962.png[/img]\xfeff[/center]\n<br />[size=4][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/105021]LINK TO THE OLDRIM VERSION[/url][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[i]Ancient Nord Armo(u)ry EXTREME (ANAE)[/i] is an armour overhaul that splits the male and female variants of the Ancient Nord set into heavy and light, respectively, and also introduces additional variants with a matching shield. All armours have weight support. [i]ANAE [/i]fixes the crafting progression of the Ancient Nord armours and spawns them in the levelled lists with enchanted variants, making the Iron-equivalent set easier to acquire earlier on. Instead of being given the ability to craft these low-level armours at the end of the Companions questline, [i]ANAE [/i]instead gives the more fitting reward of being able to convert the armours into powerful Nord Hero armours (requires the Advanced Armors perk).\n<br />\n<br />LIGHT SET\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Light Boots*\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Light Bracers*\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Leather Helmet*\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Light Armor*\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Huntress Armor*\n<br />\n<br />HEAVY SET\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Heavy Boots* (vanilla FormID)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Heavy Gauntlets* (vanilla FormID)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Horned Helmet* (vanilla FormID)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Antler Helmet*\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Infantry Helmet*\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Lord Helmet*\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Heavy Armor* (vanilla FormID)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Medium Armor*\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Lord Armor*\n<br />[color=#00ff00]\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Ancient Helmet of the Unburned (vanilla FormID)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Helm of Yngol (vanilla FormID)[/color]\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Ahzidal\x2019s Boots (vanilla FormID)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Ahzidal\x2019s Gauntlets (vanilla FormID)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Ahzidal\x2019s Helmet (vanilla FormID)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Ahzidal\x2019s Armor (vanilla FormID)\n<br />\n<br />MISC\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Shield*\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Ahzidal\x2019s Ring of Arcana (vanilla FormID)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Ahzidal\x2019s Ring of Necromancy (vanilla FormID)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Ancient Nord Amulet (vanilla FormID)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022\xa0The\xa0Gauldur Amulet\xa0(vanilla FormID)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Kyne\x2019s Token (vanilla FormID)\n<br />[color=#00ff00]\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Everscorch (greatsword)[/color]\n<br />\n<br />*upgradable to 'Nord Hero' versions\n<br />\n<br />If you desire something a bit lightweight for your game, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/39501725]Parapets[/url] has created [b][i][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65124]Ancient Nord Armo(u)ry Lite[/url][/i][/b], a lightweight edit to [i]ANAE[/i] (that is hard for me to abbreviate as an acronym, if I might add) that strips down a bunch of [i]ANAE[/i]'s extra stuff down to the basics. [i]ANA Lite[/i] (see what I mean?) still requires ANAE, so read its installation instructions.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />TECHNICAL AND COMPATIBILITY NOTES\xa0([color=#00ff00]GREEN DENOTES V1.1 CHANGES[/color]):\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 These armours are only craftable at the Skyforge\n<br />\xa0 \xa0\xa0\x2022 All armour addons are altered\xa0[s]but the vanilla .nifs remain unaltered (except the male gauntlet meshes, which have been enlarged slightly)[/s].\xa0[color=#00ff00]Assume that all of the vanilla Ancient Nord nifs have been replaced.[/color]\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 You can use texture replacers on the Ancient Nord armours (since they are reshapes of the vanilla armours). However, the Nord Hero armours, the Ahzidal set, and the Ancient Nord Lord Helm have unique textures, so you would have to modify them yourself if you want to make them consistent with your preferred texture mod(s).\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 This mod does not affect the armours on the actual Draugr enemies, nor does this mod let you take the armour off of a Draugr\x2019s corpse.\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 The Ancient Nord Lord Helmet has a different set of .nifs and its own skin, so it won\x2019t be affected by any Helm of Yngol Replacer you \xa0have.\xa0[s]The Helm of Yngol itself is affected by a darker reskin, which you are free to delete.[/s]\xa0[color=#00ff00]As of V1.1, the Helm of Yngol has its own set of nifs in addition to a new reskin.[/color]\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022\xa0[color=#00ff00]As of V1.1, The Ancient Helm of the Unburned (AHotU, the best acronym I might add) though retaining its vanilla armour FormID, its armour addons are unique. On a related note, the greatsword accommpanying the AHotU, Everscorch, overwrites the cell record that originally places an enchanted greatsword. I don't know how these changes would conflict with other mods and a patch may be required depending on your mod setup.[/color]\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 The enchantments of Kyne\x2019s Token and the Helm of Yngol have been buffed.\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 The levelled lists for Nordic ruins have been altered to have more Nordic-styled weapons and armours. Use Wrye Bash (or similar program) to create combined levelled list patches. Nord Hero armours and weapons will not or ever be placed in Nordic ruins or wielded by Draugr (I mean come on, an undead monster called a \x201c\x44\x45\x41THLORD\x201d wielding a weapon for a hero lol)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 The Ancient Nord Amulet has been given its own blank skin while Kyne's Token has its own Kyne carved skin. The amulet has been given a crafting recipe.\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 The Ahzidal set has its own corundum texture with an alternate Lord Armor mesh and needs to be improved with corundum. Ahzidal\x2019s rings have been given their own .nifs with their own unique looks.\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Aela the Huntress\x2019 outfit and class have been altered, so she wears her familiar huntress attire, while being proficient in the light armour skill (to counteract the USKP change).\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Some of the Heroes of Sovngarde (and Ysgramor) wear the Nord Hero armours.\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 The Heavy Armour pieces and Light Armour pieces use the keywords \x201c\x44LC2ArmorMaterialNordicHeavy\x201d and \x201c\x44LC2ArmorMaterialNordicLight\x201d, respectively. The Medium Armour and Infantry Helmet are classed as heavy armour, being made of iron.\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Please check if you have any mesh replacers that conflict with this (eg. [i]Practical Female Armors[/i]).\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Please understand that although I did my best on the weight painting, some armours may clip.\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 All modded cuirasses have [i]Frostfall [/i]and [i]Survival [/i]keywords, with the Lord cuirasses offering the most coverage and warmth.\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022\xa0\x41ll .esps are marked with the ESL flag.\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 All armours have [i]Weapons Armor Clothing and Clutter Fixes[/i] keywords and most stats are consistent with it. Install the [i]Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered[/i] ([i]CCOR[/i]) patch to obviously make [i]ANAE\xa0[/i]work with [i]CCOR[/i]. Place [i]ANAE\xa0[/i]after [i]WACCF\xa0[/i]and [i]CCOR[/i].\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 Please understand that I make patches for mods that I play. If you want to patch for this mod, go right ahead (and credit me).\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \x2022 I have not tested your preferred acronymed booby skeleton mod with [i]ANAE\xa0[/i]and it would most likely be incompatible. You are free to make a compatibility patch yourself but please don\x2019t expect me to do it.\n<br />\n<br />I originally conceived this mod early in 2018, but since I didn\x2019t have the know-how on how to port between Blender, NifSkope and Skyrim, the scope of the mod was limited to reskins, so I held off it until I could do it justice. After I made [i]Finally A Steel Plate Shield For The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Special Edition)[/i], I used what I learned to export the male reshapes of the female Ancient Nord armour I was working on successfully to Skyrim and suddenly, [i]ANAE[/i]\x2019s original scope was not only possible, but I can also do more. And I did.\n<br />\n<br />CREDITS:\n<br />All mesh reshapes and custom meshes were made by me. All of the original meshes and textures were made by Bethesda Game Studios.
