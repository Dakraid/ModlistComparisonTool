nexusDescription="[center][size=3][i]\"By Akatosh, all the blood. The smell of flesh burned and pulled apart by magic. I never want to do that to another soul ever again.\"[/i]\n<br />\n<br />Madena, the Court Wizard of Dawnstar, is a veteran battlemage of The Great War. As she makes abundantly clear through her dialogue, her experiences during that war have weighed heavily on her. She has since vowed to never again harm another living being, regardless of any orders her Jarl may give her. And yet, she will happily sell the player any of those same spells that she has sworn off. This mod changes that.[/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[left][color=#1e84cc]\xfeff[/color][/left][color=#00ffff][size=4][b]Details:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Madena no longer sells any Destruction spells or scrolls, and no offensive spells from any other school.\xa0[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]She instead focuses on healing and defensive spells.\xa0[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]As is the case with USSEP, she also sells Adept-level Restoration spells, rather than Destruction in Vanilla.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]The USSEP Investor perk change was forwarded to this mod, so USSEP is a requirement.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff][size=4]Specific Details on Spell Availability:[/size][/color]\n<br />[/b][size=3]\n<br />[u]Vanilla Version:\n<br />\n<br />[/u][spoiler][u]Novice:[/u][u]\n<br />[/u]   \xfeff-\xa0\x41lteration:\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff-\xa0\x43\x61ndlelight\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff- Oakflesh\n<br />   -

I do not recommend uninstalling this at any time during a playthrough, and will be unable to provide any troubleshooting assistance if you decide to do so.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff][size=4]Compatibility:[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[size=3]The only changes I made were to Madena's specific merchant chest, so as long as another mod does not alter that, this should be fully compatible with it.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff][size=4]Optional Versions:[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[size=3]I have included a version tailored to\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839]Mysticism[/url], which includes some new spells added by that mod, as well as its individual changes to the tier of certain spells and scrolls, as well as the addition of staves to wizard merchants.\n<br />\n<br />Unfortunately, I am unable to provide separate versions for Apocalypse, Odin, and Triumvirate. These mods distribute their spelltomes through scripts, not leveled lists, and I am severely lacking when it comes to scripting ability.\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff][size=4]Credits:[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[size=3]Thank you to the Unofficial Patch Project Team for fixing the Investor perk for Madena.\n<br />Huge thanks to SimonMagus616 for his outstanding \"SimonRim\" modding suite, and for even giving me this idea in the first place.[/size]"
