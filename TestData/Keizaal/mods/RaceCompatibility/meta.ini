nexusDescription="[i]If you use this mod in your custom race mod, please let me know, so I can add a link on this page and because I love seeing your work.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />The XBox 1 can be found here: [url=https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3241963]https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3241963[/url]\n<br />Consider this a beta version. It requires USSEP and needs to come after it in your load order.\n<br />\n<br />[2022-04-10] Version 2.15: Better Vampires 8.7 support updated for latest changes\n<br />\n<br />[b]=== INTRODUCTION ===[/b]\n<br />This package allows mod authors to make their custom races based on the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10165]RaceCompatibility.esm[/url] (please consider endorsing expired6978's original mod, since without that we wouldn't be able to play with all these custom races) to work properly with the Dawnguard DLC. As such mod authors should follow the instructions included with that mod to make their mod.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59220]StackEmHigh has created a guide that you may find useful in creating a custom race as well.[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Dawnguard changed several scripts involving vampirism and lycanthropy (werewolves) that meant custom races would not be able to fully benefit/experience the DLC. This mod merges the Dawnguard scripts with the Race Compatibility scripts.\n<br />\n<br />The RaceCompatibility.esm file included in this package also fixes the missing WoodElf (Bosmer) race entry in the file and adds an optional compatibility script for the Unofficial Skyrim patch.\n<br />\n<br />[b]=== INSTALLATION ===[/b]\n<br />To install just overwrite the files from the RaceCompatibility mod with the files in this package; install the optional script if you are also using the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]USSEP[/url]. To make your custom race fully compatible ensure that your vampire race has the \"vampire\" keyword, if you had not added that already.\n<br />\n<br />[b]=== NOTE ===[/b]\n<br />Note that because the esm file modifies a formlist from the original mod it may be necessary to start a fresh game to fully benefit from the changes unless they were already using a fixed version of this file (adding the WoodElfRace to the list); a fixed version for Skyrim without Dawnguard [s]can be found under optional files of the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17077]Belua Sanguinare mod[/url][/s] is included in this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[b]=== HOW TO MAKE A CUSTOM RACE BASED ON THIS MOD ===[/b]\n<br />More recent info:\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59220]StackEmHigh has created a guide that you may find useful in creating a custom race as well.[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Old info:\n<br />1. Follow the instructions on the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10165]RaceCompatibility.esm[/url] page to construct your race.\n<br />2. To make your mod Dawnguard compatible overwrite the vanilla scripts and RaceCompatibility.esm.\n<br />3. (OPTIONAL) To ensure [s][url=http://http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]UFO[/url] and/or[/s] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]USSEP[/url] compatibility add the optional scripts as an optional install.\n<br />4. Optional [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1925]Better vampires SE[/url] scripts are now included. Only use these if you are using Better Vampires.\n<br />\n<br />Preferably direct users to this mod and let them overwrite the files themselves instead of including the current version in your mod, unless you want to keep everything up-to-date as well.\n<br />\n<br />[b]=== Skyrim Special Edition RACE MODS USING THIS FIX ===[/b]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1493]Half-Giant Race by michael2mandy mcarbonara[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1745]The Noiral Reloaded by Wyldsong and Arisen1[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3166]Dagi-Raht Race by TheUnexpected[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5513]Playable Rieklings SSE by Abbalovesyou[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6378]Vintage Sea Elf race by Mudran[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11905]Riekling Followers SSE by Abbalovesyou[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14489]Ohmes-Raht Race -

Then do your clean save, then re-install Better Vampires and then re-install this mod WITH the Better Vampire option. Then you need to make sure NMM/BOSS has placed the mods in the correct load order (as described below).\n<br />\n<br />If you are having problems with a custom race and Better Vampires, please ensure that your load order is as follows:\n<br />The correct load order for playing with Better Vampires is:\n<br />\n<br />Skyrim.esm\n<br />Official DLC\n<br />...\n<br />Unofficial Patch (if you use them)\n<br />...\n<br />RaceCompatibility.esm\n<br />...\n<br />RaceCompatibilityUSKPOverride.esp (only if you use the USKP/USLEEP)\n<br />...\n<br />Custom Races\n<br />...\n<br />Better Vampires esp\n<br />...\n<br />\n<br />If problems persist, you may have another mod modifying the PlayerVampireQuest. Move Better Vampires after that mod and everything should work as designed.\n<br />\n<br />If you are still having problems PLEASE contact me. Everyone, so far, who has had issues with Better Vampires that contacted me was able to play normally with a custom race afterwards. I can't help you, if I don't know what the problem is.\n<br />\n<br />Here are some instructions by user Octoboy about a full BV upgrade:\n<br />[quote]\n<br />\n<br />Since so many people seem to have problems with Better Vampires and RaceCompatibility (myself included), I decided to write a very detailed, step-by-step guide that helped me play my custom race with Better Vampires.

Added preliminary Sacrilege support. Updated manual install instructions.\n<br />\n<br />[2020-06-11] Version 2.11: Better Vampires 8.5 Support.\n<br />\n<br />\xfeff[2020-04-13] Version 2.10: Better Vampires 8.4 Support.\n<br />\n<br />\xfeff[2019-09-01] Version 2.09:  Fixed internal version number. Reset plugin ESM flag.\n<br />\n<br />[2019-08-25] Version 2.08:   Updated Sacrosanct patch. Checked Better Vampires 8.3 Support.\n<br />Improved installer to better handle compatibility with certain mods \n<br />(Moonlight Tales) and Mod Managers. Updated Unofficial patch support, removed a\n<br />few unneeded fixes. Fixed missing entries in genericcontrollerscript for \n<br />beast-like custom races; added code to allow this to work even if mods don't \n<br />update, as long as the provided genericracecontroller script is being used and\n<br />not a provided one; Thanks to FelesNoctis for the report. Set all files to have\n<br />the archive flag as certain Mod Managers can't handle the mod properly\n<br />otherwise.\n<br />\n<br />[2018-03-03] Version 2.07:  Updated Sacrosanct patch. Checked Better Vampires 8.2 Support\n<br />\n<br />[2017-04-27] Version 2.06: Better Vampires 8.0 support. Should also be fine for 8.1.\n<br />\n<br />[2017-02-19] Version 2.05: Better Vampires 7.9 support. Small improvement to sacrosanct patch as well. If you have any problems with RC and Sacrosanct please report them.\n<br />\n<br />[2017-01-15] Version 2.04: Better Vampires 7.9 support.\n<br />\n<br />[2016-12-03] Version 2.03: Added Better Vampires 7.8 support. Added Sacrosanct 2.0.3 support. Kicks in whenever you are transformed into a vampire. If you play around with custom races and you are a vampire you might have to get re-infected for the new races to be picked up by Sacrosanct.\n<br />\n<br />[2016-11-13] Version 2.02: Removed now unnecessary esm workaround from installer. Added Better Vampires 7.5 compatibility.\n<br />\n<br />[2016-11-05] Version 2.01: Fixed missing installer entries and added optional entry for the non-esm version of the mod. Do not install this option if you are not having issues or while you are modding a race.\n<br />\n<br />[2016-11-05] Version 2.00: First beta release for the Skyrim Special Edition. I've removed several options for mods that have not been converted to SSE (yet). They may return in time. It's well past midnight here, so I'm pushing this out untested, so keep a backup of your saves handy. \n<br />Added support for Better Vampires 7.4 SE, I had to disable some SKSE related code in the overlapping scripts belonging to BV to get it to compile (wouldn't work anyway, since there is no script extender yet for SSE).\n<br />\n<br />[2016-09-18] Version 1.99: Fixed Better Vampires 7.3 support.\n<br />\n<br />[2016-09-15] Version 1.98: Updated to Better Vampires 7.3. BROKEN! Please update to 1.99\n<br />\n<br />[2016-03-04] Version 1.97: Updated to Better Vampires 7.2. Updated documentation to make it clear USKP and USLEEP are both supported.\n<br />\n<br />[2015-09-07] Version 1.96: Updated to Better Vampires 7.1.\n<br />\n<br />[2015-06-09] Version 1.95: Updated to Better Vampires 7.0.\n<br />\n<br />[2015-05-27] Version 1.94: Updated to Better Vampires 6.9.\n<br />\n<br />[2015-05-23] Version 1.93: Updated to Better Vampires 6.8.\n<br />\n<br />[2015-05-03] Version 1.92: Updated to Better Vampires 6.7.\n<br />\n<br />[2015-03-26] Version 1.91: Repackaged several translations.\n<br />\n<br />[2015-02-23] Version 1.90: Updated to include latest USKP changes.\n<br />\n<br />[2014-12-14] Version 1.89: Repackaged to include some missing languages\n<br />\n<br />[2014-07-14] Version 1.88: Added manual installation instructions.\n<br />Added minor missing script fix on the DG+USKP branch.\n<br />\n<br />[2014-07-14] Version 1.87: Added fix for amulet of Julianos from USKP.\n<br />Made companionshousekeepingscript more robust against other mods altering the properties on the quest, such as the aMidianBorn Skyforge Steel optional esp. Thanks to ElminsterAU for the report.\n<br />\n<br />[2014-03-21] Version 1.86: BV 6.6 fix incorporated.\n<br />\n<br />[2014-03-09] Version 1.85: BV 6.6 support.\n<br />\n<br />[2014-01-01] Version 1.84: BV 6.5 support. Merged back dummy translations for non-standard languages for easier installation.\n<br />\n<br />[2013-12-23] Version 1.83: Fixed a minor oversight involving some armor addons for amulets/rings. Added translations for all languages I have the source files for. If you want to provide another translation, please contact me, and I will integrate your translation into the mod package.\n<br />DummyTrans: Added dummy translations for other languages (just the English texts).\n<br />\n<br />[2013-11-02] Version 1.82: Updated with latest Unofficial patch changes\n<br />\n<br />[2013-10-21] Version 1.81: Update for Better Vampires 6.41 (the second)\n<br />\n<br />[2013-10-18] Version 1.80: Improved compatiblity with alternate start mods when using multiple custom races (thanks en_hawk for the tip). Reorganized GenericRaceController script to clean up the code and make maintenance easier while allowing easier customization (by request). Updated Better Vampires optional for version 6.4/6.41.\n<br />REUPLOAD: Fixed NMM version number\n<br />\n<br />[2013-08-27] Version 1.73: Updated installer scripting to better deal with Vampiric Thirst. It should no longer install any version of PlayerVampireQuestScript.pex, so that the Vampiric Thirst version can take over. This required some changes to the way the Dawnguard related files are installed, so report any issues, even if you do not use Vampiric Thirst.\n<br />\n<br />[2013-08-04] Version 1.72: Updated Better Vampires optional for version 6.31\n<br />\n<br />[2013-08-03] Version 1.71: Updated Better Vampires optional for version 6.3\n<br />\n<br />[2013-07-05] Version 1.70: Added an optional script fix for the vampire lord transformation. Normally the vampire lord race transformation only stores your vampire race the first time you transform. If your race was not correctly set at the time, any vampire lord transformation will return you to the wrong race. This fixes this problem by storing your original vampire race each time. Do not use in combination with mods that change the dlc1vampiretransformvisual.pex script, excluding the Unofficial Dawnguard Patch, since this file is already includes the same changes. (Better Vampires, Vampiric Thirst and Belua Sanguinaris are all compatible at the time of this writing.)\n<br />\n<br />[2013-05-22] Version 1.68: Updated Better Vampires optional for version 6.2\n<br />\n<br />[2013-04-25] Version 1.67: Updated Better Vampires optional for version 6.1\n<br />\n<br />[2013-04-19] Version 1.66: Added updated USKP override files I apparently forgot to package in the 1.64 update. Sorry.\n<br />\n<br />[2013-03-30] Version 1.65: Updated for Better Vampires 6.0 (Note that the mortal's mask ability does not change your custom race appearance as this requires the presence of a second vampire race that is basically a clone of your original vampire race without the vampire appearance)\n<br />Also changed the name from \"RaceCompatibility for Dawnguard plus vanilla version upgrades\" as it was a little long and no longer entirely correct.\n<br />\n<br />[2013-03-19] Version 1.64: Updated for Unofficial patches / Skyrim 1.9\n<br />\n<br />[2013-03-04] Version 1.63: Added Better Vampires 5.9 support (new version) (updated 1 script). Haven't done extensive testing, but should work.\n<br />\n<br />[2013-03-03] Version 1.62: Added Better Vampires 5.9 support (updated 1 script).\n<br />\n<br />[2013-02-24] Version 1.61: Added Better Vampires 5.81 support (updated 2 scripts).\n<br />\n<br />[2013-02-20] Version 1.60: Added Better Vampires 5.8 support (updated 2 scripts). \n<br />\n<br />[2013-01-04] Version 1.50: fixed a few minor annoyances in the NMM installer, added the vampiric thirst (DG) patch to the NMM installer and added UFO only optionals (though you really should try USKP).\n<br />\n<br />[2012-11-30] Version 1.41: fixed a minor issue with the esm being compiled against another version of a script. Update to this version if you don't want 2 messages about script properties not being there anymore. I'm also taking the NMM version out of beta, since it seems to work.\n<br />\n<br />[2012-11-28]: Version 1.4 Beta: NMM installer with all options.\n<br />\n<br />[2012-11-07]: Version 1.3a. I forgot a little fix yesterday for the DB cook quest for vanilla race vampires.\n<br />\n<br />[2012-11-06]: Version 1.3 was just uploaded. This version fixes some issues with more recent versions of the USKP, as well as a few minor fixes with the gauldur amulet potentially not showing for Nord vampires (bug in vanilla).\n<br />\n<br />[2012-10-06]: Version 1.2 was just uploaded. This fixes issues with multiple custom races. It is best to start a new game, but if you insist on continuing with an existing game, please follow the instructions in the included readme file."
