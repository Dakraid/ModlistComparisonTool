nexusDescription="The graceful, adorable, slightly disgusting Nix-hound. The Creation Club released a very well-detailed Nixhound. It's a beautiful model. Wait...what's wrong with its eyes? \n<br />\n<br />\"Look over here Nixy! No, not at the things to my left and right simultaneously. Look at me!\"\n<br />\n<br />But it can't. Because it has a terrible case of walleye.\n<br />\n<br />This mod simply adjusts the model a bit so that the eyes are a little more normal. They still point off a bit like chameleon eyes, but they should be much less jarring. Now you can look at your faithful Nixhound again without getting nauseous!\n<br />\n<br />If you like the nix-hound as is, this mod is not for you. If you don't have the nix-hound creation, this mod is not for you.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/22480/22480-1547051208-1244366811.png[/img]"
