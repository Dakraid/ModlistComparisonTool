nexusDescription="[center][font=Georgia][size=6][b][img]http://i.imgur.com/4ttWyac.jpg[/img][/b][/size]\r<br />[color=#6aa84f]by SA547\r<br />\r<br />[/color][i][color=#00ff00][size=3][b]This mod is to be downloaded and used free of charge.[/b][/size][/color][/i]\r<br />[/font][/center]\r<br />This mod attempts to fill out a discrepancy in which the area, according to lore, should have the remains of the old fort and currently serves as a battle monument in which Tiber Septim (as Hjalti) defeated the Reachmen by shouting down its walls and led troops to retake it successfully.\xa0\r<br />\r<br />This mod also uses special collision boxes with L_NAVCUT for easier NPC navigation, instead of modifying the navmesh wholesale (which is a time-consuming process).\r<br />\r<br />Large structures such as the wall and the towers have been given the Full LOD flag so that they should be visible at any distance, and compatible with known LOD-building utilities.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#93c47d]Backstory[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />For a very long time, one of the biggest bothersome things I noticed about the game was that, although the NPCs residing in the Old Hroldan Inn talk of a famous battle that took place around the place, and that some history texts say that Tiber Septim, then called Hjalti Early-Beard and later Talos Stormcrown, led an army to retake Hroldan, then considered a vital target to regain the Reach. But he had the Thu&#39;um as his weapon, tearing down walls, blasting away enemies off their feet, and thus won the battle and would later make the only standing structure -- the Inn -- as his temporary headquarters and residence for one night.\r<br />\r<br />Looking around, however, there wasn&#39;t a sign that Old Hroldan used to be a small town, or any remnants of the battle that catapulted Tiber Septim to the history books, as the only landmarks was an ancient leftover of the Dwemers converted into a Dibellic shrine, and the Inn itself.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#93c47d]About the Enhanced Edition[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />The [i]Enhanced Edition[/i] includes the following additions:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]A player home for three, with complete set of crafting\xa0\x65quipment, plus a fountain for which to fill up\xa0water supplies (if you&#39;re using mods such as iNeed)\r<br />[*]A Redguard vendor selling basic necessities but\xa0\x63\x61n also accept stolen goods as payment\r<br />[*]The ruins are also guarded by either the Markarth\xa0guards or Stormcloak sentries, depending on who\xa0wins Soljund&#39;s Sinkhole in the Civil War.\r<br />[*]Banners and the stele also reflect who takes over\xa0Soljund&#39;s; if the Stormcloaks take over the Imperial\xa0\x65mblem is torn down and their banner is attached in its\xa0place.\r<br />[*]Plus some little things that you may have to find for yourself around the ruins.\r<br />[*][color=#00ffff][b]The new Undercroft[/b], which includes Forsworn Specters and requires a minimum of level 20 to survive it. However, the Undercroft is enabled for radiant quests, which means you will get a job from Raerek clearing the dungeon, or a hostage rescue mission if assigned to the Companions.[/color]\r<br />[*]CHECKED and CLEANED with TES5Edit 3.11\r<br />[/list][color=#ff00ff]\r<br />[/color][size=2][color=#ff7700]Do note, however, that unlike the regular edition, all buildings in the Enhanced Edition have the [/color][color=#ffff00][i]Is Full LOD[/i]\xa0\x61ttribute removed[/color][/size][color=#ff7700][size=2], because for some reason I experienced a glitch in which the structures were completely invisible. I recommend the option to use TES5LODGen or DynDOLOD to generate proper LOD for this mod.\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[b][color=#93c47d]Compatibility Information[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]May or may not have any clipping or navmesh issues with mods that modify bridges.\xa0\r<br />[*][b]Not compatible[/b] with Shezrie&#39;s Old Hroldan Town, Hroldan Nightgate (the complete version), or any other mod that changes the Old Hroldan exterior.\r<br />[*]Slightly compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/81073/]Apachii Divine Elegance[/url] where its store is right where the stele is sited. Only problem is that the stele is in the same place as the alchemy table, and some characters may move strangely because of the changes in the navmesh.\r<br />[*][b]Compatible[/b] with Lanterns of Skyrim\r<br />[*]Compatible with Markarth Reach Environment\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b][color=#93c47d]Installation[/color][/b] -- beforehand, please make a hard save inside any interior (including the Old Hroldan Inn itself), then install the mod using any mod manager.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#93c47d]Uninstallation[/color][/b] -- make a hard save in any interior, and then uninstall this mod. For the Enhanced Edition, remove the accompanying BSA file.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#93c47d]Notice[/color] --[/b]\xa0this mod is released exclusively for Nexus Mods and TES Alliance.
