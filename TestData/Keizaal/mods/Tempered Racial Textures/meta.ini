While there are a few other mods that have done similar things in the past, I never quite liked them because I felt they either took too much creative liberty with the textures chosen, chose poor textures, or--most importantly--didn't stick to a unified texture art style. This mod makes races unique while making sure that every body texture in your game feels like part of the same whole, leaving textures unified and skin colors untouched while focusing on muscle definition and body hair variance. This mod applies automatically to NPCs without editing them, as well as the player character, and does not edit racial records.\n<br />\n<br />[b]This mod [color=#f4cccc]requires [/color]Tempered Skins.[/b] While it will [i]function [/i]without TS, you will have neck and foot seams, it will be your fault, and I will laugh at you derisively when you complain to me about it. I have deliberately [i]not [/i]packed in the head and foot textures. This means that the player may choose whichever head normal and specular options for they prefer during Tempered Skins installation (TRT works with all of them). The default body texture that you choose when installing Tempered Skins will still be used for NPCs that are not included in TRT, though since almost every race that uses a humanoid body texture is included, that's unlikely to occur unless you install a custom race mod without its own body textures.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f4cccc]You [b]must[/b] install the [b]default vanilla body meshes for both genders of Tempered Skins[/b]\xa0in the Tempered\xa0Skins FOMOD for this mod to work correctly. The high-poly vanilla male body mesh won't work. Versions for other body meshes will be provided at a later date.\xa0[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[center][font=Georgia][color=#cccccc][size=4]Racial Changes[/size][/color][/font][/center]\n<br />So what does this mod change, exactly? Each race has been given their own base texture based upon two parameters: body hair and muscle definition. In general, I have been conservative with muscle definition, as most races would not inherently be muscular or very muscular--this would be something that makes more sense to do at the NPC level. The exception is orcs, who are very muscular by default. Elves, with the exception of orcs, have no body hair, which was a deliberate design choice on my part to further distinguish them from humans. Specific changes are as follows:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Altmer [/b]have [color=#fff2cc]no[/color] body hair and [color=#fff2cc]non-athletic[/color] builds. (Body [color=#fff2cc]1[/color][color=#fff2cc]1[/color])\n<br />[*][b]Bosmer [/b]have [color=#fff2cc]no[/color] body hair and [color=#fff2cc][/color][color=#fff2cc]non-athletic[/color]\xa0\x62uilds. (Body [color=#fff2cc]1[/color][color=#fff2cc]1[/color])\n<br />[*][b]Bretons[/b]\xa0have [color=#d9ead3]light [/color]body hair and [color=#fff2cc]non-athletic\xa0[/color]builds. (Body [color=#d9ead3]2[/color][color=#fff2cc]1[/color])\n<br />[*][b]Dunmer [/b]have [color=#fff2cc]no [/color]body hair and [color=#d9ead3]athletic [/color]builds. (Body [color=#fff2cc]1[/color][color=#d9ead3]2[/color])\n<br />[*][b]Imperials[/b]\xa0have [color=#d9ead3]light [/color]body hair and [color=#fff2cc]non-athletic\xa0[/color]builds. (Body [color=#d9ead3]2[/color][color=#fff2cc]1[/color])\n<br />[*][b]Nords [/b]have [color=#ead1dc]moderate [/color]body hair and [color=#d9ead3]athletic [/color]builds. (Body [color=#ead1dc]3[/color][color=#d9ead3]2[/color])\n<br />[*][b]Orsimer [/b]have [color=#d9ead3]light[/color] body hair and [color=#f4cccc]very muscular[/color] builds. (Body [color=#d9ead3]2[/color][color=#f4cccc]4[/color])\n<br />[*][b]Redguards [/b]have\xa0[color=#ead1dc]moderate\xa0[/color]body hair and\xa0[color=#d9ead3]athletic\xa0[/color]builds. (Body\xa0[color=#ead1dc]3[/color][color=#d9ead3]2[/color])\n<br />[/list][size=4][left][font=Georgia][color=#cccccc]\n<br />A Note on Body Hair[/color][/font][/left][/size]Body hair parameters currently don't really apply to women. This is a design limitation imposed because Tempered Skins simply doesn't have female textures with non-pubic body hair. If this changes, the mod will be updated accordingly. Give us body hair for women! It's a thing that exists!\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cccccc][size=4][font=Georgia]Compatibility[/font][/size][/color]\n<br />TRT is extremely compatible. This mod does not edit RACE records, so it should be inherently compatible with race mods like Aetherius, Imperious and Morningstar without needing a patch. NPC body changes are done at the racial level and no NPC records are touched either, so the same goes for NPC-affecting mods. TRT should be compatible with practically anything else, provided it doesn't edit the ARMO record SkinNaked or its elven variants. This mod does not edit anything related to beast races in any way, so bugs affecting them are not this mod's fault. I recommend loading this mod after any other body texture mods, just in case. This mod is ESL-flagged, so it won't count towards the ESP cap.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][color=#cccccc][size=4]Modder's Resource[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />This mod also expands the visual customization of characters as a modder's resource. With every NPC now able to have one of 16 body types, NPC overhauls that use TRT as a master now have an entirely new field of customization, making the NPC customization process more modern and advanced than ever before. See the attached article for documentation (when I finish typing it up, anyway) if you are an author who would like to use TRT functionality in an NPC mod.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][color=#cccccc][size=4]Hypothetically Asked Questions[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[b]Will you add nude options? The vanilla body isn't nude enough, Catir. I want hot bods with acronyms.[/b]\n<br />Working on it. Will be in a separate file.\n<br />[b]Will you add options for skin textures besides Tempered Skins?[/b]\n<br />No.\n<br />[b]Do you have permission to use Tempered Skins textures?[/b]\n<br />Yes.\n<br />[b]Where's Extended Cut?[/b]\n<br />I'm working on it.\n<br />[b]Will this conflict with my race overhaul mod?[/b]\n<br />Can you read?\n<br />\n<br />[center]\xfeff[/center][center]Thank you, and enjoy!\xfeff[/center]"
