nexusDescription="Performance friendly 3D replacer for the clover plant.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is based on the clovers from Cathedral 3D - Pine Grass, however there are many more 3D clovers in the performance version. This is not a grass mod but replaces the clover plant!\n<br />\n<br />The performance version is 765 triangles and 1287 vertices, which is slightly above the average complexity for a vanilla plant.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />For perspective, fps loss was not appreciated for plant models with less than 200,000-500,000 triangles (depending on the vertex count).\n<br />\n<br />[center]Your support is greatly appreciated! \xa0[url=https://www.patreon.com/DrJacopo]Patreon[/url][/center]"
