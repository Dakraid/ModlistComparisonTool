nexusDescription="Bald Astrid because she was too cute with hair.\n<br />\n<br />No seriously leave if you haven't finished the Dark Brotherhood questline.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />\n<br />Pictures available.\n<br />\n<br />Partially compatible with Astrid mods, incompatible with those who change Astrid Final Form.\n<br />Regular Astrid is untouched. If you have a mod that changes her but want her to look like this at the end, load this mod after your Cute Astrid Overhaul.\n<br />\n<br />ESL flagged plugin named .esp for sorting.\n<br />\n<br />Fixes from USSEP forwarded.\n<br />\n<br />Tribute to the Mother of Dragons as my inspiration for this mod, even if it may look like I was inspired by Revenge of the Sith."
