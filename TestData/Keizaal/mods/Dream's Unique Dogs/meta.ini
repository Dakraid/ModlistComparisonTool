[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Comments that show you obviously haven't bothered to read said waffle will most likely be ignored. You have been warned :)[/b][/size]\n<br />[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#0070C0][size=4][b][u]Description[/u][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This is my attempt to make mans best friend, a friend worth having. At the \n<br />moment if you want a dog follower, other than names there isn\x2019t really \n<br />any difference between who you choose. I want to create something that \n<br />will make a difference between who you choose to join you, so needless \n<br />to say some new textures are just the beginning. I want to change \n<br />meshes, sounds, stats\x2026. Whatever I can till we can say these dogs \n<br />finally have a bit of \x201cpersonality\x201d. If you have any ideas feel free to \n<br />chip in, however don\x2019t be offended if your suggestion doesn\x2019t get put \n<br />in. And more importantly I hope you get some enjoyment out of this mod \n<br />should you decide to use it!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#0070C0][size=4][b][u]The Texture Replacer[/u][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The texture replacer gives every named dog in the game a unique texture. \n<br />\n<br />This includes\n<br />- Meeko\n<br />- Vigilance\n<br />- The stray dog\n<br />- Barbas\n<br />- Torom \n<br />- Stump\n<br />- Ysgramor\n<br />- Tiber\n<br />\n<br />Now, any other dogs, for example bandit\x2019s and hunter\x2019s dogs will use the \n<br />standard vanilla texture. I want to add more dogs in the future but at \n<br />the same time I want to keep the file size and the performance hit to a \n<br />minimum. That is the one golden rule I want to stick to. Personally I \n<br />don\x2019t have a pc that was meant for gaming (seriously, not in the \n<br />slightest!) and I must be using just about every trick in the book to \n<br />make Skyrim run the way I want (almost anyway). So naturally performance\n<br /> is important to me. I can safely say this mod won\x2019t touch your \n<br />performance unless you use hd textures. Scroll down to find instructions\n<br /> on how to do this. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#0070C0][size=4][u][b]How to install[/b][/u][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />ONLY CHOOSE ONE FILE!\n<br />It installs just the same as any other mod. If your not sure how to install mods then follow the instructions below.\n<br />\n<br />[b]To use nexus mod manager[/b]\n<br />\n<br />1. Click on the files tab above the description\n<br />&gt;2. Click on \x201c\x64ownload with manager\x201d\n<br />3. NMM will open and download the file for you. When it\x2019s finished \n<br />downloading it will appear in the \x201cmods\x201d tab. Just click to highlight it\n<br /> and then click the button on the left that says \x201c\x61\x63tivates the selected\n<br /> mod\x201d when you hover the mouse over it. \n<br />4. You\x2019ll then see it appear in the \x201cplugins\x201d tab, just make sure the box next to it is ticked and your ready to go!\n<br />\n<br />Really, nothing different from how you would install any other mod. For Vortex just click \"install with manager\" and follow the steps.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Updating[/b]\n<br />\n<br />It's just the same as installing the file for the first time, when \n<br />installing manually follow the steps above and overwrite the old files \n<br />where asked. With nexus mod manager uninstall the old version first and \n<br />then install the new one. don't run more than one version at the same \n<br />time, I dread to think what that might do lol\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#0070C0][size=4][u][b]To-Do List[/b][/u][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />So here's what I want to happen for Unique Dogs....\n<br />\n<br />[s]- Port to SE (it works anyway off the bat but let's just cover all bases)[/s]\n<br />- get the less barking back in\n<br />- Maybe an MCM for choosing your own models and textures?\n<br />- Change the follower dogs to be better followers, better at sneaking, extra features etc\n<br />- Make all that changeable via MCM\n<br />- Definately want more \"unique\" dogs to adopt. I like the idea of a \n<br />hunting dog who can \"fetch\" like I've seen in another mod. No idea how \n<br />to do it though! \n<br />- Make it very compatible with other mods\n<br />- give stump that stumpy tail :) \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#0070C0][size=4][u][b]Ideas to Ponder....[/b][/u][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />- Increased follow distance. Cause if Meeko headbutts me one more time....\n<br />\n<br />- A unique mesh for every dog. With the condition that it MUST fit in \n<br />with the game (lore friendly I guess) I am not making chihuahuas, \n<br />poodles or sausage dogs not matter how much you ask me and how adorable \n<br />they are! \n<br />\n<br />- Custom sounds. That bark would be a lot less annoying if it wasn\x2019t as frequent and there was more variety, so \n<br />different barks for different dogs essentially. \n<br />\n<br />- Stats and AI. Whole other kettle of fish. I don\x2019t want to add scripts (since they can \n<br />leave that footprint on your saves) and I want stats to fit the \n<br />individual dogs. So for example vigilance is a trained war dog that you \n<br />have to pay money to own. Maybe he should have higher stats to reflect \n<br />this but to balance this out there should be a downside, maybe he \n<br />effects sneak level, sets off traps, he\x2019s more a fighter and a bit of a \n<br />pain when it comes to anything else. Whereas Meeko was probably a more \n<br />family friendly dog, his owner certainly didn\x2019t look like a warrior so \n<br />maybe he would be more likely to run from a fight, and maybe there could\n<br /> be an advantage to balance this out, like a \x201cpack-bag\x201d and inventory \n<br />space for example, more a \x201cutility companion\x201d. Something that gives you a\n<br /> reason for picking a specific dog. \n<br />\n<br />- And finally an mcm menu thingy (cause I love customization)\n<br />\n<br />Seriously though guys I\x2019ve never released a mod before and I\x2019m a bit of a newbie \n<br />so this may not be the most polished mod on the nexus, so take \n<br />everything with a pinch of salt. Don\x2019t be afraid to lecture me on bad \n<br />modding practices though, sometimes the only way we learn is through our\n<br /> mistakes and \x201c\x63reative\x201d criticism.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks guys, and happy adventuring! \n<br />\n<br />[color=#0070C0][size=4][u][b][color=#0070C0][size=4][u][b]Credits and Thank yous![/b][/u][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/u][size=2][color=#ffffff]   Fierymarigold - thank you for reaching out to me with tutorials and help with meshes!\n<br /> I'd still be stuck if you hadn't messaged me and i totally forgot to \n<br />say thank you..... so thank you. any new meshes coming in the future are\n<br /> thanks to this awesome mod maker :) \n<br />\n<br />Darkfox127 - for many many MANY no nonsense youtube tutorials on everything you could ever need!
