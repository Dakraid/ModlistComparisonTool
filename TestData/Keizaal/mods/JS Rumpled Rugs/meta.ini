Want a more immersive experience with rugs that look unkempt? Well look no further!\xa0\n<br />This mod replaces nearly 300 rug references with brand new, disrupted meshes.  This is not a straight up model replacer. Not all rugs are affected, only the ones that make sense![/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]\x2022 Adds 50+ new rug mesh variants (4 total variants per rug including default)[/size]\n<br />[size=2]\x2022 Conflict-free ESL Plugin\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][b]Interactive version:[/b]\xa0\n<br />[/color]\x2022\xa0\x41ll common rugs will now have a chance to be messy and can be fixed by the Player by interacting with the center of the rug. The rug will randomly become unkempt again after 1 day but may take as long as 2 in-game weeks to get messy again. If a rug has already been fixed, it won't be interactive until it has become messy again.\n<br />\n<br />\x2022\xa0Unkempt rugs can also trip the Player &amp; other NPC's. There is a 3% chance when walking, 5% chance when running and 7% chance when sprinting. Sneaking &amp; the Light Foot Perk will 100% prevent you from tripping.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[center][youtube]lSQVkhNZtFY[/youtube][youtube]00iHG_VUCx4[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/ZM71deY.png[/img][/center]\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966]Required Mods:\n<br />[/color][/b][size=2]\n<br />\x2022 [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805]Base Object Swapper[/url] (For distribution)\n<br />\x2022 [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9030]Detailed Rugs[/url] or\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5436]RUGNAROK[/url] (For textures &amp; compatibility)\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff0000]Note:[/color][/b] This mod was made for compatibility with the above two texture mods &amp; any other rug mod that uses the same meshes.

Custom collision will be made later on if the mod is well received.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />2) Some of the rugs look less rigid and more cloth-like?\n<br />[color=#b6b6b6][size=2]\x2022 This was a byproduct of the previous point and while it couldn't be totally avoided, I wanted a more lively appearance.\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />3) I noticed that areas such as Dragonsreach, Inns &amp; Sovngarde don't have unkempt rugs?\n<br />[color=#b6b6b6][size=2]\x2022 These are some of the areas that I felt don't make sense to have unkempt rugs. Palaces &amp; Inns have workers that would keep things clean, whereas Sovngarde should be immaculate.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />4) Why isn't there an LE version?\n<br />[color=#b6b6b6][size=2]\x2022 LE doesn't have Base Object Swapper and would be a compatibility nightmare. A script based version might be made later on.\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />5) You missed this other type of rug that's not in the common folder!\n<br />[color=#b6b6b6][size=2]\x2022 Let me know and I'll see about adding it as an update.\xa0[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/ZM71deY.png[/img][/center][size=2]\n<br />\x2022\xa0If for some reason the files do not work, cause crashes or any other problems, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n<br />\x2022\xa0\x41ll screenshots are taken directly from the game and resized down from 1920x1080 to 1280x720.
