nexusDescription="[center][color=#00ff00][b]What does this mod do?[/b][/color][/center]\n<br />This mod uses the Great Cities series' Reach Town/Village house architecture to overhaul the single house at Kolskeggr Mine, effectively finalising coverage of non-farm or otherwise uniquely architectured houses in the hold.\n<br />\n<br />This settlement mod is completely standalone, however, it is intended to be used alongside the following:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36350][/url][url=http://][/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33189]The Great Village of Old Hroldan\xfeff[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33032]The Great Town of Karthwasten\xfeff[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Also available are my lighting tweaks to the above mods to make the house interiors feel a little more homely. The tweaks are contained only to the cells and light placements in the houses and touch nothing else. If you are using a patched lighting overhaul, such as one of those found on the \"Patch Collection\" for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37650]Old Hroldan[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37471]Karthwasten[/url] [i](Links will take you to the corresponding Patch Collection)[/i], you should skip my tweaked plugins as they will conflict.\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#00ff00][b]Compatibility[/b][/color][/center]\n<br />This mod will likely conflict with mods that edit Kolskeggr Mine and/or the interior of the house.\n<br />\n<br />[b]I currently offer this mod as is and will not be providing any patches for other mods[/b], although people are free to make and upload any patches they like.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#00ff00][b]Credits[/b][/color][/center]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/10182460]Archinatic[/url]\xfeff for making the Great Cities mods and providing the archtiecture as a [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35021]modders resource[/url]\xfeff."
