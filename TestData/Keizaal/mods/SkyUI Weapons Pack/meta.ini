nexusDescription="This mod will add additional icon/types to SkyUI via the use of keywords. Any weapon containing any of the specific keywords will be displayed as such when viewed in SkyUI. The goal is to allow any weapon mod to be able to display a unique icon and type that would better fits it's category.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Requirement:[/b][/u]\n<br />SkyUI - This mod is designed as an addon to enable additional contents with SkyUI, so needless to say will require such.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Compatibility:[/b][/u]\n<br />Not compatible with other similar mods of SkyUI as this one. As long as the other mod and this mod does not alter these same following files then \n<br />there shouldn't be a problem.\n<br />\n<br />bartermenu.swf\n<br />containermenu.swf\n<br />craftingmenu.swf\n<br />favoritesmenu.swf\n<br />inventorymenu.swf\n<br />icons_item_psychosteve.swf\n<br />the translation txt files\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Usage:[/b][/u]\n<br />To have a weapon display these icon/types you must have one of these keywords attach to that weapon. These keywords are not ID based however they are case sensitive.\n<br />\n<br />WeapTypeSpear\n<br />WeapTypeJavelin\n<br />WeapTypePike\n<br />WeapTypeHalberd\n<br />WeapTypeRapier\n<br />WeapTypeQuarterstaff\n<br />WeapTypeClaw\n<br />WeapTypeScythe\n<br />WeapTypeWhip\n<br />WeapTypeKatana\n<br />WeapTypeGun\n<br />\n<br />For example, if you add a WeapTypeClaw to a Mace on top of it's existing keywords, SkyUI will detect this keyword and display your Mace as a Claw in the inventory even though it's still fully functional as a Mace and still has all it's previous keyword intact.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Credits:[/b][/u]\n<br />schlangster - Original uploader to SkyUI.
