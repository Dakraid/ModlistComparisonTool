nexusDescription="[size=4][b]RUSTIC SPRIGGAN - Special Edition[/b] is a hi-res retexture of the four types of Spriggans found in Skyrim. The two that were in the base game, the Spriggan and Spriggan Matron, and the two found in the DLCs, the Dawnguard Earth Mother variant, and the Dragonborn Burnt Spriggan variant.\n<br />\n<br />[b]UPDATE:[/b] I added an optional file with new textures for the animated leaf effect. I never cared for the generic blob leaf shape, so I gave it a defined and detailed leaf. The leaf tile texture that's used on the body is also included, so leaves\xa0sprout from the body as well. I\xa0\x63hanged the gradient textures a bit, the main improvement being with the Earth Mother variant where the leaves are no longer\xa0\x62lack, but purple to better match the interior glow effect color.\n<br />\n<br />The Spriggan is a curious creature in that it appears as if it was made from dead wood, rather than living trees. They resemble a collection of driftwood pieces, rather than an animated tree trunk. I wanted to bring out the woodgrain and cracks of the weathered wood, so the new \"rustic\" textures have more surface detail and depth than the originals. The wood now has a more\xa0\x61ncient appearance. When wood has been subjected to fire, the grain and cracking becomes more evident, so I tried to get this appearance into the \"burnt\" version.\n<br />\n<br />I've never been a big fan of the animated \"leaf\" effect, particularly with the Earth Mother\xa0variant, since it is\xa0\x62lack which\xa0obscures the textures, making it hard to take decent screenshots. Perhaps someone will take a crack at improving that effect some day.\n<br />\n<br />I hope people like this new addition to my series of RUSTIC retextures for Skyrim. The normal map uses the newer BC7 compression to\xa0\x61lleviate artifacts. 4K and 2K texture options available. Use whichever version works best with the available VRAM of your setup.\n<br />\n<br />Cheers,\n<br />Gamwich[/size]"
