nexusDescription="[size=3]When it comes to making mods, I apparently have the attention span of a skeever, and end up making a load of relatively small mods that I play around with but never get around to polishing or uploading, and many just sit on my hard drive for months while I go off to work on new things. Here's a collection of those mods.\n<br />[/size][size=3][size=3]\n<br />[/size][size=4][u][b]Decorate[/b][/u][/size][size=3][size=4][b][u] (Updated 3 of October, 2018)[/u][/b][/size][/size]\n<br />[size=3][spoiler][/size][size=3]\n<br />[/size]This mod allows you to position items with precision using the Decorate lesser power.\n<br />\n<br />The power can be obtained by either reading a Decorating Guide for one of the vanilla houses, or by crafting \"Decorating Tips\" at a forge. Once you have the lesser power, use it, then activate any object.\n<br />\n<br />You will be given the option to \"Move\", \"Rotate\", and \"Nudge\". Selecting \"Move\" will keep the item upright and directly in front of you. Simply move your camera to move the object to where you want it, crouch to place it. Selecting \"Rotate\" will allow you to rotate the object on the X,Y, or Z axis by simply looking left or right of the object, crouch to stop rotating. These two options will disable havoc physics on the object, select \"Nudge\" to re-enable havoc physics.\n<br />\n<br />You can also create a number of containers and furniture at a forge, or at the woodworking bench. Drop the items, then activate while you are Decorating. You will be able to move them like before, as well as being able to \"Place\" them, turning them into useable furniture objects. When they're useable objects, you can move and rotate them as normal, and \"Take\" them at any time while Decorating.\n<br />\n<br />The number of furniture items to craft and place is still small at the moment, this mod may be expanded in the future.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[size=3][size=3]\n<br />[/size][size=4][u][b]Frostflow Lighthouse Repaired[/b][/u][/size][size=3][size=4][b][u] (Updated 3 of October, 2018)[/u][/b][/size][/size]\n<br />[size=3][spoiler][/size][size=3]\n<br />[/size]Frostflow Lighthouse is my favorite vanilla dungeon, due to its location and story. It also makes a fantastic player home.\n<br />\n<br />With this mod, after you avenge the family of Frostflow Lighthouse, you can repair and clean the lighthouse, and bar up the entrance to the abyss below it. Turning it into a usable player home.\n<br />\n<br />All items and containers in the lighthouse will no longer respawn, while the items and enemies in the abyss below will respawn as normal.\n<br />\n<br />An anvil, grindstone, armor table, and wood-chopping block have been placed in and around the lighthouse.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[/size][/size][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3]\n<br />[/size][size=4][u][b]Simple Thralls[/b][/u][/size][size=3][size=4][b][u] (Updated 3 of October, 2018)[/u][/b][/size][/size]\n<br />[size=3][spoiler][/size][size=3]\n<br />[/size]Any NPC can now be turned into willing thralls if you feed on them while they are under your Vampire's Seduction.\n<br />\n<br />Thralls will become potential followers and spouses, and they will be treated as your lovers.\n<br />\n<br />The chance to turn a thrall is based on the NPC's Level, your Speechcraft Level, and your relation with them.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3]\n<br />[/size][size=4][u][b]Toggle Menus[/b][/u][/size][size=3][size=4][b][u] (Updated 3 of October, 2018)[/u][/b][/size][/size]\n<br />[size=3][spoiler][/size][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3]\n<br />[Requires SKSE][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size]\n<br />[/size]Adds a hotkey that turns the HUD on and off. Useful for screenshots.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3]\n<br />[/size][size=4][u][b]Vampire Lord Flight[/b][/u][/size][size=3][size=4][b][u] (Updated 3 of October, 2018)[/u][/b][/size][/size]\n<br />[size=3][spoiler][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size]\n<br />[size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][Requires SKSE]\n<br />[/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size]You can fly in Vampire Lord Form when sprinting. This may cause you to sink into the floor.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][size=4][u][b]Simple Necromancy[/b][/u][/size][size=3][size=4][b][u] (Updated 17 of May, 2018)[/u][/b][/size][/size]\n<br />[size=3][spoiler][/size][size=3]\n<br />This is a fleshed out (heh) Skeleton-Raising mod somewhat inspired by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35378]Corpse Preparation[/url]. You have to dissect corpses or find skeletons out in the world, then raise them with some alchemical ingredients. For most parts of this mod, you will need to know one of the vanilla reanimation spells to get the options.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Carrying Corpses and Skeletons[/u]\n<br />If you are sneaking and activate a corpse, you will get the option to pick it up. You can only carry one corpse at a time, and you can't store the corpse in a container. You can drop it by dropping the Corpse skull in the misc section of your inventory.\n<br />\n<br />You can also pick up rigid skeletons, as in skeletons that have their limbs attached. You can carry an unlimited number of them, but you also can't store skeletons in containers. Like corpses, you drop them by dropping the associated skull in the misc section of your inventory. The skull will be called something like \"Fragile Warlock Skeleton\".\n<br />\n<br />[u]Burying Corpses\n<br />[/u]If you want to get rid of a corpse for whatever reason, you can. You will have to pick up the corpse and take them to some exterior area, and you have to have a shovel in your inventory to have the option[size=3][size=3] (which can now be crafted at a forge)[/size][/size].\n<br />\n<br />[u]Dissecting Corpses[/u]\n<br />If you have an embalming tool or torture tools (which can now be crafted at a forge if you know a reanimation spell) you can dissect hominid corpses, if they aren't vampires or otherwise undead already. You will get some organs and flesh from it.[size=3] If you enable the CACO patch, you will get blood and other appropriate organs from that mod.[/size] Depending on your Conjuration and Alchemy skill, you will get either an intact skeleton or a ruined skeleton. A ruined skeleton will have to be repaired to be raised.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Repairing Skeletons[/u]\n<br />[size=3]If you find a loose skeleton, as in skeletons that don't have their limbs attached, you can attempt to repair them. You will need either a Blacksmith's Hammer or Blacksmith's Tongs (which can now be crafted at a forge), as well as some leather strips and iron ingots. Stronger skeletons will require more materials to repair. The chance to successfully repair the skeleton is dependent on your Conjuration and Smithing skill. If you fail, you will instead salvage the skeleton.\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[u]Salvaging Skeletons[/u]\n<br />If you can't repair a skeleton, or don't want you, or simply want to get rid of a skeleton, you can salvage one. Salvaging will give you a random number of bones which could either be stored or assembled into a different skeleton.\n<br />[u]\n<br />Assembling Skeletons[/u]\n<br />[/size]To assemble a full skeleton, you will need a Skull, Ribcage, and Left and Right Skeletal Arms, Hands, Legs, and Feet. As well as either a Hammer or Tongs, and leather strips and iron ingots. When you have everything you need, drop a skull on the ground and activate it. It will give you the option to assemble a skeleton.\n<br />\n<br />You are guaranteed to successfully assemble a skeleton, but the strength of it will depend on your Conjuration and Smithing Skills.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Raising Skeletons[/u]\n<br />When you finally have a rigid skeleton, you can raise it. Raising a skeleton will require some Magicka, as well as Bone Meal and Nightshade. If you are low on Nightshade, you can replace it with a greater number of Lavender flowers. If you are skilled in Conjuration and Enchanting, there is a chance the skeleton will still be rigid after being killed. Raising a skeleton will permanently drop your maximum Magicka by 25, until the skeleton is killed or released. There is a hard cap of 20 skeletons that can be simultaneously raised, which will require 500 Magicka to maintain.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Skeletons[/u]\n<br />Skeletons are divided into three classes: Warriors, Warlocks, and Archers. They are also divided into 5 \n<br />strength levels: Fragile, Weak, Sturdy, Strong, and Robust. The class \n<br />and strength of the skeleton is dependent on the skill of the corpse, or\n<br /> your skill if you try to assemble one from individual bones.\n<br />\n<br />When you have a risen skeleton, you can command them to either Trade, Wait, Follow, or Release. Skeletons can carry much, probably just their weapons. You have to raise a very strong skeleton to get any sort of pack mule out of this. Wait and Follow commands should be intuitive. If you Release the skeleton, it will kill them, and give you back the Magicka required to keep them animated.[/size]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />[/size][size=3][size=4][b][u]Realistic Tempering (Updated 17 of May, 2018)[/u][/b][/size]\n<br />[spoiler][/size][size=3][size=3]\n<br />[Requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64283/?]Immersive Jewelry[/url]]\n<br />This is a simple SkyProc patcher that changes tempering of Armor and Weapons. Instead of using a full ingot to temper an item independent of what kind of item it is, this patch uses the metal tabs and bars from Immersive Jewelry, and sets the amount required to temper an item dependent on the weight of the item. Also, it changes the perk requirements for tempering, so items can be tempered only if you have the appropriate smithing perk, regardless of whether or not it is enchanted.\n<br />\n<br />So, instead of using a full iron ingot to temper a small iron dagger, you will now only require an iron tab, and if you enchant it, you won't need to grind Smithing to 60 to temper it.\n<br />[/spoiler][/size]\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />[/size][size=3][size=4][b][u]Saddlebags (Updated 17 of May, 2018)[/u][/b][/size]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />A very simple horse-management mod.\n<br />\n<br />If you crouch while activating your horse, you can store items in the horse's inventory. They're set to have a carrying capacity of 500.\n<br />\n<br />You will also get a Horse Whistle lesser power, which will toggle your horse following you or waiting.\n<br />[/size][size=3][/spoiler]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[/size][size=3][size=4][b][u]Set Outfit (Updated 17 of May, 2018)[/u][/b][/size]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[Requires SKSE]\n<br />This is a work-in-progress outfit management mod. With this mod, you can bundle some armor together into an outfit misc item at a tanning rack. If you give someone this outfit, it will change their outfit to the one you gave them. This mod is very WIP, with only a few outfits setup. There is also currently no system to get the armor back out of the outfit item.\n<br />\n<br />These are the outfits currently set up:\n<br />-Banded Iron Armor (No Shield)\n<br />-Leather Armor (No Helmet)\n<br />-5 Farm Clothes Outfits\n<br />-Blades Armor\n<br />-Blades Armor (No Helmet, No Shield)\n<br />-Wolf Armor\n<br />-Wolf Armor (No Helmet)\n<br />[/size][size=3][/spoiler]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[/size][size=3][size=4][b][u]Simple Playable Instruments (Updated 17 of May, 2018)[/u][/b][/size]\n<br />[spoiler][size=3][size=3]\n<br />[Requires SKSE][/size][/size]\n<br />This mod allows you to play instruments. All you have to do is pick up an instrument, and use it in your inventory. You will then start playing. Open your inventory and use the instrument again to stop playing. While playing time will be accelerated, setting the timescale to 40 by default.\n<br />\n<br />If there are NPCs nearby, they may applaud when you finish a song, which will raise your Speechcraft. If you are in an inn or a city, they may toss you a few coins. If you have the Allure perk, there is a chance you will become friends with people listening to you. The better your Speech skill, the more coins you will get, and the more likely people will become friends with you.\n<br />[/size][size=3][/spoiler]\n<br />[/size][/size][/size][size=3][size=3][size=3]\n<br />[/size][size=3][size=4][b][u]Unleveler (Updated 17 of May, 2018)[/u][/b][/size]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />This is a SkyProc patch unlevels all loot and enemies. To be more specific, it unlevels all Leveled Items and Leveled Actors, and weighs the items/npcs in those lists based on the level that they already have, so low-level items and enemies are more common than high-level ones. It also weighs bosses and boss loot differently, such that you are more likely to find a high-level bosses and high-level boss loot compared to the rest of the game.\n<br />[/size][size=3][/spoiler][/size][/size][/size]"
