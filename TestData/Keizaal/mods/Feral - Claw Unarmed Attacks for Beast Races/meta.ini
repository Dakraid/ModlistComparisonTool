nexusDescription="Argonians and Khajiit, as well as any custom race tagged as a beast race, use slightly different unarmed animations from those of humans and elves. However, at some point the game designers had an even beastlier set of moves planned for them. I do not know why these animations were scrapped from the final product, but they were left in the game files. This mod offers you the opportunity to use these animations in your game for specific races. By default, this mod affects Argonians, Khajiit, and their vampire counterparts. Optionally, these animations can also be applied to vampires, and werewolf players.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff0000]IMPORTANT:[/color][/b] This mod requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33746]Dynamic Animation Replacer[/url] and [url=https://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][u][b]The Animations:[/b][/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The game files do not contain the complete set of beast race animations, but the important ones are all there. This mod restores these animations:\n<br />\n<br />- Regular attacks in all directions (1st and 3rd person).\n<br />- Power attacks in all directions, including dual attack (1st and 3rd person).\n<br />- Sneak attacks (1st and 3rd person).\n<br />- Unarmed idle (1st and 3rd person).\n<br />- Unarmed movement (3rd person only).\n<br />\n<br />I recycled some of these animations to fill in for the missing ones:\n<br />\n<br />- Unarmed movement, walking and running (1st person).\n<br />- Sneaking unarmed idle (1st and 3rd person).\n<br />- Sneaking movement (1st and 3rd person).\n<br />\n<br />Only the recoil animations are left unchanged, but their omission isn't very noticeable.\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]MJuNs9-4ZWw[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][u][b]Installation:[/b][/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This mod comes in several different flavors. You need to install only one version:\n<br />\n<br />- [color=#00ff00]Feral - The Beast Within[/color] affects Argonians, Khajiit, Argonian vampires and Khajiit vampires.\n<br />- [color=#00ff00]Feral - Shadow of the Beast[/color] affects Argonians, Khajiit, Argonian vampires, Khajiit vampires and werewolves (player only).\n<br />- [color=#00ff00]Feral - Go for the Throat[/color] affects  Argonians, Khajiit, and ALL vampire races (vanilla and custom).\n<br />- [color=#00ff00]Feral - Tooth and Claw[/color] affects  vanilla Beast races (but not custom ones), ALL vampire races (vanilla and custom) and werewolves (player only).\n<br />- [color=#00ff00]Feral - Unleash the Beast[/color] affects  ALL Beast and Vampire races (vanilla and custom).\n<br />- [color=#00ff00]Feral - Welcome to the Jungle[/color] affects  ALL Beast and Vampire races (vanilla and custom), and werewolves (player only).\n<br />- [color=#00ff00]Feral - Rip and Tear[/color] affects  all races. Dynamic Animation Replacer is not needed for this version.\n<br />\n<br />- You can install the mod using your mod manager of choice, or you can install it manually by extracting the files into your Skyrim Data folder.\n<br />- There is no esp for this mod.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][b][u]Claws (Optional File):[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />I have included three optional files that add equipable claws to the game. Use only one of them. The animations and the claws are not dependant on each other, and can be used separately.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][u]Feral - Claws:[/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />- Claws can be crafted at a tanning rack using Bear Claws.\n<br />- Claws can be upgraded to Powerful Claws at a tanning rack, consuming a Daedra Heart. Powerful Claws scale your unarmed damage with the level of your One-Handed skill. The effect works if you have a spell, magic staff, shield or torch equipped in one hand, but is deactivated if you equip a melee or ranged weapon.\n<br />- The claws can be used by any race.\n<br />- The claws take up body slot 61, and may not show up if your character has items that use that slot as well. Since this is not the same body slot as the hands, your claws will still show up if your character equips gloves or gauntlets.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][u]Feral - Claws - Beast Races:[/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />- In addition to the changes listed above, Argonians, Khajiit, and their vampiric counterparts automatically get claws.\n<br />- The sound FX for unarmed attacks by Argonians, Khajiit and their vampiric counterparts have been changed to those used by werewolves.\n<br />- Equipable claws can still be crafted and used, though they will be invisible.\n<br />- This file may be incompatible with mods that edit the Argonian, Khajiit, ArgonianVampire and KhajiitVampire races.\n<br />- Use this file with the \"Shadow of the Beast\" or \"The Beast Within\" versions of Feral.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][u]Feral - Claws - Beasts and Vampires:[/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />- This file makes the same changes as \"Feral - Claws - Beast Races\", but applies them to human, elven and orcish vampires as well.\n<br />- This file may be incompatible with mods that edit Argonian, Khajiit, and vampire races.\n<br />- Use this file with the \"Go for the Throat\", \"Tooth and Claw\", \"Unleash the Beast\" or \"Welcome to the Jungle\" versions of Feral.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][u][b]Acknowledgments:[/b][/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The claw meshes for the optional file are from \"[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52918/?]Better Claws and Gauntlets[/url]\", by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1750291/?]Derok[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7153984/?]Didact2401[/url]."
