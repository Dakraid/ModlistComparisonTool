nexusDescription="In vanilla, the Forgemaster's Fingers are created by the quest to look for them.\n<br />This means if you're an orc or just generally not racist against orcs about which quests you take, you'll eventually become Blood-Kin, so no one will bother with giving you the quest, and the possibility of the Fingers existing will collapse into a sea of things that never were.\n<br />This mod adds them to one guy, and causes the quest to send you after him instead.\n<br />Also they're now Orcish Gauntlets instead of Iron and add an extra level of tempering to Orcish weapons and armor.\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/52904][img]https://i.imgur.com/cET5e0Z.png[/img][/url][/center]"
