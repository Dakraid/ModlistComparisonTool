nexusDescription="This is a simple texture and mesh edit I made for my own playthroughs. I preferred the red and gold coloring of the Ayleid gear from Beyond Skyrim and hated the vomit green color that the CC Ayleid Wights were given. I darkened the gold a bit and changed the cloth color to a dull red. I also adjusted the mesh shaders for the armor pieces to give them a gold specular color instead of the original pale green. I made a duplicate texture for the wight's body separate from their chest piece in the mesh so I could easily change the armor colors without affecting the wight's skin color.\n<br />\n<br />Note: These are altered versions of the base game textures. Quality upscaling is a bit beyond my skillset, and I don't think I would be able to replicate my original work from scratch using upscaled vanilla textures. I made these for myself and wanted to share, so if someone wants to upscale and upload themselves, feel free to do so."
