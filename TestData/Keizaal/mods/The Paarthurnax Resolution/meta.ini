Does it matter that he's spent thousands of years in repentance, and defected to defeat a worse tyrant?\n<br />\n<br />It doesn't matter how you answer that question. What matters is that everyone involved has their own answer. The Blades need vengeance against a monster, and the Greybeards insist on the pacifism their order was founded on. Neither side can bend on this; the question is fundamental to both. Caught between those who would use you to destroy their enemies with no regard for your choice, and those who refuse to leave their mountain while the world burns, you cannot take both sides. You must choose: will you kill Paarthurnax?\n<br />\n<br />This mod adds the simple option to tell Delphine that you will not kill Paarthurnax. It is available from the start of the quest, because after all this time, what is left to say? It will immediately end the quest. Even if you kill Paarthurnax later, the Blades will not forgive this slight and you will never be quite as welcome. But Delphine and Esbern are the remnants of a dead order, and after starting the quest Paarthurnax and finishing Season Unending or the Civil War, they are no longer essential to your story. Should you find being ordered to execute your friend sufficiently offensive, some actions speak louder than words.\n<br />\n<br />The Paarthurnax quest has always, for me, been a loose end. I was told to choose, and I did; I did not choose the Blades, and the quest was left forever unfinished without the ability to truly choose for Paarthurnax to live. Now, that story can reach the simple ending I always meant it to.\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/52904][img]https://i.imgur.com/cET5e0Z.png[/img][/url][/center]"
