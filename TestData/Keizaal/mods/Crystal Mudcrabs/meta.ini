nexusDescription="[center][/center][center][b][color=#b4a7d6]\xfeffWhy Crystal Mudcrabs?[/color][/b][/center]\n<br />In a recent expedition to Blackreach, I decided that the place needed a bit of fauna diversity. The endless Falmer, Chaurus, Automatons and that one Giant needed to have a counterpart in the passive category to make it feel a little more like an ecosystem than a deathtrap and thus Crystal Mudcrabs was born.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#b4a7d6][b]What does this mod do?[/b][/color][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Adds a new larger variety of mudcrab to Blackreach styled areas with their own creature skeleton file, meshes and textures with relevant loot.\n<br />[*]Create a more powerful mudcrab that feels like it could actually survive in the harsh, falmer and chaurus dominant, ecosystem by giving them the tools to fight back when threatened.\n<br />[*]Aims to have as many patches as possible to keep the mudcrabs appeased in most load orders (found a conflict, let me know so I can patch it)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[center][color=#b4a7d6][b]What doesn't this mod do?[/b][/color][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Overhaul anything in Blackreach.\n<br />[*]Edit any vanilla levelled lists, should be compatible with any other creature mods.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[center]\xfeff[/center][center][b][color=#b4a7d6]Currently available patches[/color][/b][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565]Wyrmstooth[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924]Complete Alchemy &amp; Cooking Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130]Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul[/url]\xfeff (and also its food addon)\n<br />[/list][center][b][color=#b4a7d6]Incompatibilities[/color][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />The only true compatibility problem I could see with this mod is a Blackreach overhaul possibly placing something on the same spot as a mudcrab. If you fid one of these, let me know and I will see about patching it."
