nexusDescription="Vanilla candle flicker is accomplished with a repeating loop of different textures, to provide the illusion of a moving flame. This effect is bolstered by a fully animated, semi-transparent aura texture plastered over the top of it to simulate candle glow.\n<br />\n<br />As a result of this costly effect being included on every single candle, low-end devices struggle mightily with common, highly used things like homes, ruins, and arcane enchanters. This mod replaces the aura texture with a completely blank one, allowing you to have a staring contest with an entire ROOM full of candles with zero lag.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility:[/b]\xa0Should be compatible with everything. Allow my mod to overwrite if you do ever find a conflict.\n<br />\n<br />Cheers."
