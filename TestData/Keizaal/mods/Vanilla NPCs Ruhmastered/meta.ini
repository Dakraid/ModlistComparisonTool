Brought eye fixes up to SUEMR 3.0/Eyes AO Clipping Fix 1.3.\xa0 Incorporated new mouth meshes.\xa0 Included BVFE fangs into main file.\n<br />v2.0 - NEW Misc Files for EFA\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Practical Usage:\n<br />[/b]\n<br />The purpose of this mod is NOT to be an NPC Overhaul like WICO.\xa0 But rather, think of it as a baseline improvement that you can install on top of.\n<br />For instance, say you want to use all the Bijin mods and SNNR together.\xa0 Sure, alot of NPCs are replaced, but hardly all.\xa0 This just fills in the gaps.\n<br />\n<br />However, if you are using Expressive Facial Animation, then you NEED the MISC files here in order for NPCs to use EFA's tris effectively.\xa0 All the bug reports point to one thing...NPCs with vanilla teeth in their facegens attempting to use the tris ment for a different mesh.\xa0 Solution:\xa0 Apply EFA teeth to all NPC facgens\n<br />\n<br />If you want to use Expressive Facial Animation by Niroku, YOU MUST USE the MISC files.\n<br />\n<br />\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation:\n<br />[/b]\n<br />1.)\xa0 Install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch[/url].\xa0 You absolutely MUST have it installed.\xa0 Seriously.\xa0 No exceptions.\n<br />Next, Install the main file from here.\n<br />\n<br />2.)\xa0 If you want to use the optional Beast Race Glow file, install it after the main file here and allow it to overwrite.\n<br />\n<br />3.)\xa0 If you want to use one of the optional Vampire files, install it after the main file here and allow it to overwrite.\n<br />*If installing with BVFE:\xa0 Allow these facegens to overwrite BVFE's.\n<br />\n<br />4.)\xa0 If you want to use the Misc Files for EFA, install the \"Main\" Misc file\n<br />\n<br />5.)\xa0 (Optional) Then install your optional vampire glow of choice over \"Main\" Misc file\n<br />\n<br />Now you may begin installing your NPC replacer mods of choice over top of the facegens here.\n<br />\n<br />*As part of the \"Ruhmastered\" series of mods, several NPC replacer mods have already been upgraded to be on par with the facegens here.\n<br />100% compatible with all texture replacers!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Recommendations:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Highly recommended to also install Ultimate Eye Meshes, Eyes AO Clipping Fix, ENB Eyebrow Fix for Oldrim, Double Sided Vertex Human Mouth Fix, and BVFE so the player has all the same improvements as NPCs here.\n<br />*Allow Ultimate Eye Meshes to overwrite BVFE's eye meshes (Ultimate Eye Meshes has mostly all the same options, but with more fixes)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Important:\n<br />[/b]\n<br />BVFE tris were made for vanilla meshes.\xa0 They need a patch to work 100% correctly with EFA teeth.\xa0 Having vampire fangs for females and non-glitchy facial animations is a good trade off in my book.\xa0 BVFE tris do calm down male fangs though, so they have to be an improvement from vanilla.\xa0 If you notice a slight misalignment in fangs, this is why.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Credits:\n<br />[/b]\n<br />Arthmoor for USLEEP\n<br />Aipex8 for BVFE - Better Vampire Fangs and Eyes\n<br />Artsick for Eyes AO Clipping Fix and collaborating with me on the teeth meshes\n<br />Niroku for Expressive Facial Animation\n<br />triptherift for ENB Brow Fix\n<br />All the modders who made this series of improvements possible![/size]"
