Mostly I would recommend letting that mod overwrite this one. No critical    \xfeff   \xfeff\x63hanges were made to meshes this version.\n<br />   \xfeff- Any mod that adds new flora, or makes changes to existing flora or tree forms, will need a patch to attach my script.\n<br />* No Scripts Version:\n<br />   \xfeff- Use this alongside\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43532]KernalsEgg's Scrambled Bugs[/url]\xa0\x46lora Fix. This version only includes the mesh fixes.\xfeff\n<br />   \xfeff- Do not upgrade to this version if you are already using the Scripts Version. Nothing bad will happen if you have the Scripts Version and KernalsEgg's mod installed at the same time.\xa0I recommend to keep using the scripts version until you start a new game.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Requirements:[/u]\n<br />- SKSE.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Other Recommended Fixes/Mods:[/u]\n<br />-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266/]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch[/url]\n<br />-\xa0[url=http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1499]Skyrim Particle Patch for ENB\n<br />[/url]-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43532]KernalsEgg's Scrambled Bugs[/url]\xfeff\n<br />-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36042]Lilebonymace's xEdit patcher[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[u]Installation:[/u]\n<br />- For games that have not had Flora Fixes or Flora Respawn Fix installed, no special steps are necessary. Install manually or with the mod manager of your choice.\n<br />- NOTE: The fix won't apply before doing your first harvest of a plant, so if you've already harvested a plant before, you'll have to harvest them again for the fix to apply."
