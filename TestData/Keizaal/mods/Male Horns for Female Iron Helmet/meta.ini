nexusDescription="The female Iron Helmet is really disappointing. The male version of this helmet is one of the most iconic things in the entire game, and you can't even wear it depending on what character you made!\n<br />\n<br />This mod gives the female version of the Iron Helmet the same horns as the male version. This is different from other mods which changes the helmet to use the male model on female characters, which causes clipping issues because it isn't shaped properly. Instead, it replaces the helmet with a new mesh that combines the features of both vanilla models so that it fits properly. It has 2 trishapes now so that it can use both textures, but one draw call isn't going to make or break performance."
