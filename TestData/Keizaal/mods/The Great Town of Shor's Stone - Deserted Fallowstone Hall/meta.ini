nexusDescription="I love [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35977]The Great Town of Shor's Stone[/url]\xfeff by SoldierofWar and the main reason I downloaded it was because it adds a castle on the hill above the town which looks great, but I was disappointed to find it wasn't really abandoned.\n<br />\n<br /> I like to make camping a large part of my playthroughs and I thought an abandoned castle on a hill was a great spot for it so I put this together with that in mind. I cleared some space outside of the castle itself as well as replaced one of the towers with an empty one that can have a bedroll and campfire set up inside. \n<br />\n<br />For the interior I removed the light sources and replaced them with activatable torch sconces, the NPCs are gone and there is now added clutter as well as a darkened, dusty atmosphere to better show a state of disrepair.\n<br />\n<br />[b]The town of Shor's Stone is untouched, as is the vault inside Fallowstone Hall.[/b] I felt the vault was a bit silly so I've put a rock in front of the doorframe to act as a \"cave in\". The doors to the vault are unchanged however so if you still want in you can either tcl past the rock or disable it.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Tl;dr, what's changed?\n<br />Interior:\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*]No more NPCs\n<br />[*]Much darker interior, pre-lit light sources are gone but torch sconces added, bring torches if you need light!\n<br />[*]Clutter changed to look like the Hall has been abandoned for a long time\n<br />[*]Sandbox markers removed - followers shouldn't start sweeping the floors or praying\n<br />[*]Cave-in blocking the door to the vault (the vault is unchanged however so you can tcl past it or disable the rock if you still want in)\n<br />[*]Removed a couple of meshes that I thought were out of place for a Companions castle like the torture rack and coffins\n<br />[*]Beds can be slept in and items are no longer owned so can be taken\n<br />[/list][b]Exterior:\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*]Added a rock static mesh next to the destroyed building where it was possible to get stuck if you were unlucky\n<br />[*]Flattened some terrain inside one corner of the destroyed building for bedrolls or small tents\n<br />[*]Replaced the tower with one that can be entered including an upper level\n<br />[/list][b]\n<br />Requirements:\n<br />\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35977]The Great Town of Shor's Stone[/url] \n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]My other obscure mods/patches:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51747]New Legion - Rusty Oblivion Guard Armor Integration\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71854]Ryn's Halted Stream Camp - Detailed Exteriors Patch\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73132]Dawn of Skyrim - Enhanced Vanilla Trees Blue Palace Courtyard Patch\n<br />[/url]\xfeff[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52265]Dawnguard Sentries - Dawnguard Arsenal, RFM, Artefakes Patch\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52264]Dawnguard Sentries - Unplayable Faction Armour Patch\n<br />[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[/b]"
