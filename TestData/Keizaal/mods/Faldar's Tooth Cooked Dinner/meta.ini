nexusDescription="Ever think it was weird that the disgruntled chef at [url=https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Faldar%27s_Tooth_(Skyrim)]Faldar's Tooth[/url] didn't even bother cooking the meat they provided for the petulant bandits' dinner? Surely even the most ignorant of bandits would have noticed that the meat was raw! The problem obviously stems from the fact that Bethesda never provided an option to cook the type of meat being eaten, but fortunately  [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/508527]Sticz[/url] fixed that for us. All I've done here is replace the eight pieces of raw meat on the dining table (and the one in the nearby cooking pot) with the cooked version from their [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16716]their mod[/url].\n<br />\n<br />There is also a version under [b]Optional Files[/b] that removes the original crafting recipe, for those who want the immersion of the cooked meal at Faldar's Tooth but do not want the ability to cook said type of meat themselves. Download [b]one OR the other [/b]file, not both!\n<br />\n<br />Both this plugin and  [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/508527]Sticz[/url]'s mod are small enough to be flagged as esl, so you can add both to your load order without sacrificing a single plugin slot!\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Credits &amp; Requirements[/b][/size]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16716][s]A Certain[/s] Meat Cooked[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/508527]Sticz[/url]  (which you obviously need installed in order to actually [i]have [/i]the cooked meat in your game)."
