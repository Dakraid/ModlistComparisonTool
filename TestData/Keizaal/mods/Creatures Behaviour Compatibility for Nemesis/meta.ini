nexusDescription="[center][color=#ff0000][size=6]NEMESIS IS NOT FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH CREATURES\n<br />THIS WILL NOT ENABLE CREATURE ANIMATION SUPPORT IN NEMESIS[/size][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />This is just a [b]VERY HACKY[/b] compatibility patch thing for creature behaviour edits, Nemesis and Ultimate combat, as more and more mods are coming out effecting creature's behaviours it just makes sense to have something like this instead of it being inside multiple mods\n<br />It's basicly an extended version of what was included in my Flinch mod(pre v3.5) and Zxlice's Parry and backstab, localised in one place\n<br />\n<br />As a mod user you'll prolly be downloading this as a requirement, [b]it doe's nothing on it's own,[/b] if you're just using my flinch mod you can just install this and you're good, you don't need to tick anything in Nemesis, there's fomod options for Ultimate combat and Ultimate Dragons if you have etiher or both of those installed\n<br />\n<br />If you're a mod author and make a behaviour mod for creatures it's best to use this as a requirement instead of going through the effort yourself and setting it up, it will also save mods overwriting each other and confusing mod users[color=#fff2cc][color=#ffffff]. If you make an edit to a creature's behaviour that's effected by Ultimate combat/Ultimate dragons, this resource has Nemesis patch's for Ultimate combat/dragon's creatures.[/color][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The included Nemesis patches will allow creatures to perform attacks added by Ultimate Combat/Ultimate Dragons as well as other behaviour edits to creatures affected by those mods\n<br />\n<br />Horses are not included as they are a special case due to Incompatibility with Nemesis's behaviour extractor\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28384]Humanoid Vampire Lords[/url] do contain a behaviour for the Vampire lords but it's just the vanilla behaviour, there's no edits to the behaviour file, so you're safe to overwrite with this mod\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][b]This will also break if you use FNIS to generate Creature animations\n<br />There's nothing I can do about that sorry[/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#ff0000][size=6]NEMESIS IS NOT FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH CREATURES\n<br />THIS WILL NOT ENABLE CREATURE ANIMATION SUPPORT IN NEMESIS[/size][/color][/center]"
