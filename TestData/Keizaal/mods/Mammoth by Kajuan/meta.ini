I started to work on vanilla files that were 2k.[size=3] [size=3]Meshes haven't been touched and they are not inside the packages, this mod is just textures[/size][/size][/size][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3] and doesn't take any slot in your load order.[/size][/size][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]The vanilla files edited were found inside:[/size][size=2] \n<br />textures&#92;actors&#92;mammoth (3 file)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Mammoth is peaceful like his shepherd, the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6179]Giant[/url]. That's just if you don't bother them and get too close. If you do, as you know, this is a real strong animal in the game. It can easily take down a couple [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5303]Sabrecats[/url], which they are indeed true killers [/size][size=3]themselves.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/6127/6127-1526421217-275126656.png[/img][/center]\n<br />[/size][size=3]The edit wasn't that hard this time, first because I collected the material long time ago, second because the texture was easy to make it match on the edges (it have almost none in the body), third because the vanilla was not that bad after all and its alpha channel just worked well despite the resize.\xa0 [/size][size=3]Took me just a couple weeks with various hours per day. In the head within the body there is a noticeable seam, that couldn't be hidden although my tries cause the angle of the mesh. It also use, some fur extensions that it is impossible to understand from which part of the body they are taken. The head mesh is a bit strange, watching some Mammoth reconstruction pics around the net I still don't know why the author made it that way. Due to these images I decided to enlarge the fur almost till the [/size][size=3]ankles. They were around and up the knees in the vanilla.\xa0 [/size][size=3]Really the Mammouths I saw around, are completely covered by the fur, but to stay as possible near to the vanilla I did leave the other parts in the same way. [size=3]I edited the interior of the mouth as well, like everything else, but it should be hard to see it inside game without using the console.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3]Anyway, that's it, I do hope it looks a bit better now.
