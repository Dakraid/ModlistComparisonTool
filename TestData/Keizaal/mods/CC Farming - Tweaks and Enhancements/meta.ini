nexusDescription="[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Description[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod makes the following changes to the Creation Club Farming Creation.\n<br />\n<br />General changes:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Goldenhills Plantation cell: set as a \"NoReset\" zone.\n<br />[*] Goldenhills Plantation cell: default set all items as owned, prior to completing [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Unquiet_Dead]Unquiet Dead[/url].   \n<br />[*] Prior to [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Unquiet_Dead]Unquiet Dead[/url], you can find the family still alive, with some custom dialogue lines and AI packages.\n<br />[*]Pre-quest: Urval sells crops, Jonquil sells potions, ingredients and recipes and trains alchemy (up to 50).\n<br />[*]I've added exterior chimneys and dragon landing markers to the farmhouse and bunkhouse.\n<br />[*]I've added additional beds for farmhands. (Both outside, before you get the bunkhouse, and inside the bunkhouse, afterwards.)\n<br />[*]I've vastly increased the amount of fertile soil. (121 fertile soils in total)\n<br />[*]I've added a way to customize the daily income by using a multiplier. (see customization)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Unquiet_Dead]Unquiet Dead quest:\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]To start the quest, you need to be level 15 (customizable) and talk to an innkeeper in either Rorikstead or Whiterun and ask them: \"Are there any problems around town that need handling?\"\n<br />[*]Inside the house, there will be haunted objects similar to those in the [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_House_of_Horrors]House of Horrors[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />[*]Expanded the quest to where Rin can be found. (some extra quest steps.)\n<br />[*]Rin (ghost form) will have some additional lines, thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727?tab=user+files]JaySerpa[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Once [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Unquiet_Dead]Unquiet Dead[/url] is done, you will no longer instantly get the plantation, but instead:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] You can hand in the bounty of the ghosts at Whiterun's steward and get some gold as a reward.\n<br />[*] You can now buy the Goldenhills Plantation at Whiterun's steward for 10,000 gold.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Recruiting beggars as farmhands:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Up to 5 beggars are now recruitable, given you have at least performed a small favor. (have raised disposition with them.)\n<br />[*]You can buy better clothes for beggars, when they've been recruited as a farmhand.\n<br />[*][url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Snilf]Snilf [/url]\xfeff\x61nd [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Edda]Edda [/url]\xfeff\x61re recruitable by donating them one gold. (the same applies to NPCs added by mods, that are in the beggar faction.)\n<br />[*]To recruit [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Brenuin]Brenuin[/url]\xfeff, you need to complete [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Argonian_Ale_Extraction]his quest[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />[*]To recruit [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Degaine]Degaine[/url]\xfeff, you need to either fail or finish [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Heart_of_Dibella]his quest[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />[*] To recruit [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Narfi]Narfi [/url]\xfeff\x61s a farmhand, you need to complete his [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Straw_that_Broke]sister's quest[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />[*] If you recruited Narfi as a farmhand, the [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Kill_Narfi]Dark Brotherhood quest [/url]\xfeffto kill him will no longer start.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />If you have started the Dark Brotherhood quest to kill Narfi:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] When talking to Narfi, you should still have the option to start his sister's quest or recruit him as a farmhand (if you completed his sister's quest.)\n<br />[*] If you recruited Narfi as a farmhand, while you are on the Dark Brotherhood quest to kill him, you can try to persuade Nazir (Speech 75 req to succeed) to tell him you have dealt with Narfi, without the need to kill him. (But you still have an option to kill him, if you want.)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Customization[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[code]set CCFarmingLevelReq to X[/code]\n<br />X is the level requirement to start the quest. (default is 15) This only works if you haven't started the quest yet.\n<br />\n<br />[code]set ccVCSSE004_DailyGoldRewardMult to X[/code]\n<br />X is the value that the daily gold earnings is multiplied by. (default is 1) Decimal values can be used as well.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Suggested mods[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]   [*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18975]Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches[/url] -&gt; fixes many issues with the CC content.\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69559]HearthFires - Customizable Fertile Soil[/url] -&gt; Allows you to plant crops much faster.\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58880]Skyrim Anniversary - Growable Plants[/url] -&gt; Allows you to plant all ingredients from the CC content.\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69822]Creation Club Farming - Tweaks Enhancements and Quest Expansion - RS Children Patch[/url]\xfeff -&gt; patch for RS children\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]FAQ[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Q: ESPFE?\n<br />A: Yes.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is this compatible on a existing save?\n<br />A: Most likely not, sadly. The way the Creation Club Farming Creation works is by running a script at startup. Unfortunately, if this script has run, it is not easy to \n<br />undo that in a mod, like this. I'm sorry for this inconvenience, but in most cases, a new game is required.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you make a seperate version for &lt;insert reason&gt;?\n<br />A: I won't be making any seperate versions, but I might consider making the feature a customizable option.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you make a patch for &lt;insert mod&gt;?\n<br />A: Maybe, that depends on the mod, its permissions and the complexity to make said patch.\n<br />\n<br />Q: I know a cool idea: &lt;insert idea&gt;. Will you add it?\n<br />A: Maybe, depending on its complexity and my willingness to do so.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you port this to &lt;insert other version of Skyrim&gt;?\n<br />A: I only support the [color=#93c47d][b]PC Steam English Special Edition of Skyrim.[/b][/color] Any other version I won't support myself. However, I do allow others to\n<br /> port it to other version at their own responsibility. (see permissions)\n<br />\n<br />Q: Does this work with AE?\n<br />A: Maybe, I don't know. I myself use the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57618?]\"best of both worlds version of the downgrade patcher\"[/url]."
