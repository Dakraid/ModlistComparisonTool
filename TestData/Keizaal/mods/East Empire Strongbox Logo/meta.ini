I have uploaded it.\n<br />\n<br />[Description]\n<br />I always enjoyed collecting the East Empire Pendants found during the Dragonborn DLC, as there aren't very many vanilla scavenger hunt quests. While on my umpteenth playthrough, I got over-the-top irritated at the lack of a difference between the East Empire Company Strongboxes and the regular strongboxes. The textures are identical. It seems Bethesda had time to create a unique pendant model, but couldn't spare the 5 minutes I spent slapping a proper East Empire Company logo onto the strongboxes. This mod aims to fix that issue.\n<br />\n<br />[Functionality]\n<br />Because both the strongboxes have the same mesh file, it was necessary that an .esp file be created for this mod. Otherwise you'd see the East Empire Company logo on all strongboxes in the game.\n<br />\n<br />I made sure that the East Empire Company Strongbox was the only thing I edited with the Creation Kit. I also double checked with TES5Edit, so there is no reason for any issues with this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[Installation: NMM]\n<br />Click the Nexus Mod Manager download link, and when this mod had been downloaded, install it using the menu inside the program.\n<br />\n<br />[Installation: Manual]\n<br />Extract the files from the .7zip archive using an archive tool (such as 7zip) to a temporary location, then copy the East Empire Strongbox Logo.esp, an the two folders (meshes and textures) into the data folder in the Skyrim directory, usually found in the following location:  C:&#92;Program Files(x86)&#92;Steam&#92;SteamApps&#92;Common&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data\n<br />\n<br />[Uninstallation: NMM]\n<br />Remove all the added files by this mod using the uninstall feature included in the Nexus Mod Manager program.\n<br />\n<br />[Uninstallation: Manual]\n<br />Remove the following files from you Skyrim directory:\n<br />\n<br />East Empire Strongbox Logo.esp\n<br />Meshes&#92;Clutter&#92;Common&#92;strongbox_eastempire.nif\n<br />Textures&#92;Clutter&#92;Common&#92;strongbox_eastempire.dds\n<br />\n<br />[Mod Compatibility]\n<br />This mod should and will be compatible with any mod that doesn't edit the model used by the East Empire Company Strongbox.\n<br />\n<br />[Load Order]\n<br />This mod should probably be loaded after the Unofficial Dragonborn Patch and the High Resolution DLC .esp\n<br />\n<br />[Optional Versions]\n<br />I added an optional version that replaces all strongbox textures with this logo. Using this method doesn't require an .esp so make sure to use only one!\n<br />\n<br />[Credits]\n<br />Bethesda, for the original textures I used to make this\n<br />GIMP, which I used to edit the .dds files"
