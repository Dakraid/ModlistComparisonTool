nexusDescription="Small UI change for SkyUI that let it show the Warmth Value of the items. It will only show it if Survival Mode is enabled.\n<br />\n<br />This is something that I needed for my next playtrough, and as SkyUI team is not really active anymore, and as nobody else seems to want to mess with SWF files, I decided to do it by myself.\n<br />\n<br />A lot of thanks to Schlangster, creator of SkyUI, as I used the source code of SkyUI 4 that he shared as a base, so I haven't need to decompile and fix the files.\xa0[url=https://github.com/schlangster/skyui]Here it is his GitHub[/url]\xfeff."
