nexusDescription="This is my first mod, so please keep that in mind. Feedback of any kind is extremely appreciated!\n<br />\n<br />By using the mod Cities of the North - Morthal as master I could change the model of the single house in the Hjaalmarch settlement Stonehills. I've changed and\xa0 rearranged the interior so that it matches its exterior model. I added also some decorations on the outside that it matches the theme of a foreminers family home. Navmesh has been generated and should work, I didn't encounter any huge oddities when testing. \n<br />\n<br />[b][url=http://https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34168][b]CITIES OF THE NORTH - MORTHAL[/b][/url]\xa0is needed for this to work.\n<br />\n<br />A new save might be needed for the interior to work correctly! But as it's just a useless NPC's family home, it should be not a problem when added mid save. As long as you aren't looking to live in there, it should be fine.\n<br />\n<br />Please take your time and don't forget to endorse the mods from [url=http://https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/19519279]JPSteel2[/url]\xfeff and [url=http://https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/51448566]Janquel[/url]\xfeff as this wouldn't have been possible without their work.\n<br />\n<br />[/b]\n<br />For now, it's just an esp. Please, do not flag it as esl. right now as it isn't safe. This is all just new to me, so give a shout if you see something that I didn't consider when making this. \n<br />\n<br />[b]Hjaalmarch Reborn or Stonehills Reborn compability: [/b]There is one big pile of wood directly in front of the door to the house. I would like to make a patch to correct this, when I'm tackling the whole Overhaul of the settlement, but right of now, the easiest way is just to disable it via console."
