They were thought to have been wiped out[/size][/color][color=#00ffff][size=5] [font=Comic Sans MS]in all of Morrowind[/font] due to the blight ash, but hidden pockets of Vvardvark populations have survived outside of [font=Comic Sans MS]Vvardenfell[/font]. Due to the eruption of the red mountain, some have migrated westward and can be spotted near the eastern borders of Skyrim. Some pet Vvardvarks went astray into Eastmarch in past history due to the Dunmer migration. Instead of eating them when they were low on supplies, they decided to release them into the wilderness.\n<br />\n<br />Some have been carried over to Solstheim by Dunmer settlers as pets, however, some have gone astray into the wilderness.\xa0[font=Comic Sans MS]since then,[/font] the population of wild Vvardvarks living in Solstheim has increased. \n<br />\n<br />They're insectivores and they can be found in grassy and wooded areas where bugs are plentiful. Their long tongue was used as fastenings due to their elastic qualities, while their shells were used for armor by Ashlanders.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9OsMwxE.png[/img]\n<br />\xfeff\n<br />[/size][/color][/font][color=#93c47d][font=Comic Sans MS][size=5][u]Three Species to Vvardvark that can be found in Solstheim and Eastern Skyrim:[/u]\n<br />- Demotic Vvardvarks\n<br />- Dozen-Banded Vvardvarks\n<br />- Tuxedo Vvardvarks\n<br />\n<br />&amp; new loot that can be used to help make Chitin/Bonemold armor.\n<br />\n<br />- Marked as .esl[/size][/font][/color][/center]"
