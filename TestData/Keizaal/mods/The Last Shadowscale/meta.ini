nexusDescription="[center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod is orignally known as \"The Shadow Scale Set\" by\xa0Veer; Kwrrrttty and Sebastian.\xfeff\n<br />Their original mod was available in\xa0[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=german&amp;id=433736703]STEAM Workshop[/url].\n<br />Concept Art by -\xa0[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Awhirl]Veer[/url]\xa0\n<br />Import by -\xa0[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kwertyyy]Kwrrrttty[/url]\xa0\n<br />Models by -\xa0[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/sebostian]Sebastian[/url]\n<br />SSE Conversion by -\xa0[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/pfirsich]MarkusPfirsich\xfeff[/url]\n<br />Big shoutout to\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/38157850]DoktorWilp[/url]\xfeff\n<br />for porting this mod.\n<br />Full credit goes to the authors and Wilp.\n<br />\n<br />Veezara mentions in dialogue many times that he is \"a Shadowscale, you see. Born under the sign of the Shadow.\"\n<br />It seemed only fitting to equip him with his birthright.\n<br />\n<br />Armor and weapons are obtainable from Veezara, they all have tempering recipes and are unenchanted.\n<br />Crafting recipes are also added, unlocked with the 'Advanced Armors' perk.\n<br />Armor is between Scaled and Glass armors in defense, but slightly lighter.\n<br />Weapons are comparable with ebony, but also slightly lighter.\n<br />Cowl is also fully compatible with beast races now.\n<br />\n<br />This is my first of any real modifications, I appreciate any feedback and again,\n<br />all credit goes to the mod authors.\n<br />These were personal edits and I had seen multiple requests on the original port\n<br />for these same edits.\n<br />\n<br />Enjoy![/center]"
