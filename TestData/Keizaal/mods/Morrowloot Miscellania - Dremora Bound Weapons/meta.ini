Over the years, multiple reiterations were released - including [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50740]Morrowloot 4E Edition[/url] and, most recently, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3058]Morrowloot Ultimate[/url] - thanks to the original mod having open permissions. Each one was a continuation of the previous versions, refining and adding to the original concept.\n<br />\n<br />Morrowloot Miscellania is my own attempt at perfecting Morrowloot, although it has much less original work than previous iterations. I performed full-body surgery on Morrowloot Ultimate and cut out the bits I liked best. All of them are standalone but fully compatible with each other and can be combined with other loot / crafting overhauls.\n<br />\n<br />[b]All modules are snippets of MLU, meant to replace MLU in combination with other mods. Don't use them with MLU.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/l1itUFP.png[/img][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#6f9dba]HYBRID LOOT[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />[spoiler][size=3][color=#adceff][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />Based on the Morrowloot concept, Hybrid Loot significantly reduces the amount of higher level equipment found in Skyrim without turned rendering all rewards and drops worthless. Any Glass+ equipment cannot be found as random loot and must be crafted or acquired from specific places. Many items drop based on their location, for instance you will definitely find Dwarven pieces in a Dwemer ruin or Falmer cave.\n<br />\n<br />Hybrid Loot is still being tested and expanded.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]REQUIREMENTS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />None.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]CHANGELOG[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />[b]1.0[/b] Initial release.\n<br />[b]1.0.1[/b] Removed edit to MQ203AkaviriKatana which set the version of Dragonbane to always spawn with the highest level. This was on oversight on my part. Hybrid Loot is not intended to unlevel unique rewards.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]CREDITS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6877023]Umgak[/url] created the plugin.\n<br />JonnyWang for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26085]Hybrid Loot and EZs[/url] which served as base.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]FUTURE PLANS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />- Further polishing.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#6f9dba]ITEM DISTRIBUTION[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />[spoiler][size=3][color=#adceff][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />This is essentially the heart and soul of Morrowloot, the features that makes it so special among all other loot overhauls - hand-placed loot all throughout the world, hidden in secret places or given to powerful NPCs. I have included almost all cell and world space edits (with the exception of those referring to MLU's Ancient Nord Hero weapons which were moved to their own module). Also added some appropriate loading screens that were originally part of MLU.\n<br />\n<br />However - all edits to toughen up some of the NPCs were reverted. Additional shades in Kilkreath were removed. These types of changes should be made by enemy overhauls instead.\n<br />\n<br />Check the spoiler below for a list of NPCs who now have sets or pieces of rare armor or weapons.\n<br />[spoiler]- Kodlak Whitemane now wears a set of Ebony armor.\n<br />- Ulfric Stormcloak is now equipped with an Ebony war axe (instead of a Steel war axe).\n<br />- Faleen now wears a set of Dwarven armor, minus the helmet.\n<br />- Jouane Manette is now equipped with Ebony gauntlets and a matching Ebony shield.\n<br />- Ghorbash the Iron Hand now wears a set of Orcish armor, minus the helmet.\n<br />- Ogol now wields an Orcish war axe.\n<br />- Chief Mauhulakh now wears a full set of Orcish armor.\n<br />- Dushnamub now wears a set of Orcish armor, minus the helmet.\n<br />- Potema now drops an enchanted Glass sword.\n<br />- The Old Orc now wields an Orcish battleaxe and wears a full set of Orcish armor.\n<br />- Morvarth now wears Master Destruction robes.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]CHANGELOG[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />[b]1.4[/b] Gave Morvarth a unique outfit (Master Destruction robes).\n<br />[b]1.4[/b] Removed loading screen edits.\n<br />[b]1.4[/b] Removed some ITMs.\n<br />[b]1.3[/b] Plugin cleaned up by Asedael. Many dirty or redundant records were removed.\n<br />[b]1.3[/b] Removed left-over cell and worldspace records.\n<br />[b]1.3[/b] Deleted some unused NPCs, including edits to the Frost Monarch which was buffed.\n<br />[b]1.3[/b] Removed all Daedric items that were given to NPCs or placed in the world.\n<br />[b]1.3[/b] Fixed some inconsistencies with Ulfric's new ebony weapon.\n<br />[b]1.2[/b] Applied fix for Frostbite Staff (MLU 1.3.3).\n<br />[b]1.2[/b] Fixed two typos in MLCorpseCollegeMageNote.\n<br />[b]1.2[/b] Forwarded Max Height Data from the USSEP for Tamriel parent worldspace.\n<br />[b]1.1[/b] [i]Skipped because I'm bad with numbers.[/i]\n<br />[b]1.0[/b] Initial release.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]REQUIREMENTS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch[/url]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#6f9dba]DAEDRIC CRAFTING REQUIREMENTS[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />[spoiler][size=3][color=#adceff][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />This re-adds the original MLU crafting requirements for Daedric equipment with one exception - I did not re-add the requirement of crafting at night since this can just be toggled in CCOR. You still need to find a Black Book in order to begin the quest which will eventually unlock Daedric crafting (which is then only possible at the Skyforge). Also includes one related loading screen.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]REQUIREMENTS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994]Weapons, Armor, Clothng and Clutter Fixes[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28608]Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]CHANGELOG[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />[b]1.0[/b] Initial release.\n<br />[b]1.1[/b] Added missing Black Book requirement to DaedricWarAxe.\n<br />[b]1.1[/b] Reverted MLU's doubled output and required materials for Daedric Arrow crafting.\n<br />[b]1.1[/b] Fixed order of conditions on some crafting recipes.\n<br />[b]1.2[/b] Updated to use Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered as master.\n<br />[b]1.2[/b] Added new constructible object conditions from CCO Remastered.\n<br />[b]1.2[/b] Added missing Quest script \"mlu_qf_mludaedricknowledgeq_0517110e.pex\" from MLU.\n<br />[b]1.2[/b] Added ESL flag.\n<br />[b]1.2[/b] Added description, version info &amp; Author to plugin header.\n<br />[b]1.2[/b] Update by CptMcSplody!\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#ffb652]NEW[/color] [color=#6f9dba]UNLEVELED UNIQUES[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />[spoiler][size=3][color=#adceff][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />A core feature of the original Morrowloot was that unique artifacts no longer scaled with the player level. For example, in vanilla you get a weaker version of artifacts like Dragonbane or Chillrend if you complete the quests at an earlier level. With this plugin, you will always get the best version of each artifact regardless of when you complete the associated quest. The following unique items are affected:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Tsun's Battle Axe\n<br />[*]Gauldur Blackblade\n<br />[*]Gauldur Blackbow\n<br />[*]The Pale Blade\n<br />[*]Chillrend\n<br />[*]Dragonbane\n<br />[*]Shield of Solitude\n<br />[*]Nightingale Sword\n<br />[*]Nightingale Bow\n<br />[*]Nightingale Hood\n<br />[*]Nightingale Gloves\n<br />[*]Nightingale Armor\n<br />[*]Nightingale Boots\n<br />[*]Miraak's Staff\n<br />[*]Miraak's Sword\n<br />[*]Miraak's Mask (light)\n<br />[*]Miraak's Mask (heavy)\n<br />[*]Miraak's Robes\n<br />[*]Amulet of Articulation\n<br />[*]Mage's Circlet\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]COMPATIBILITY[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />Only touches leveled lists. Fully compatible with Unique Uniques, WACCF, ROM, etc.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]CHANGELOG[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />[b]1.0[/b] Initial release.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#6f9dba]DREMORA BOUND WEAPONS[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />[spoiler][size=3][color=#adceff][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />In vanilla, Dremora drop fire-enchanted weapons ranging from Iron to Daedric depending on their level ([url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dremora]more info[/url]). In order to make Daedric weapons more rare, MLU added a new set of Bound Weapons (that cannot be looted by the player) to replace the vanilla weapons. Note that with neither their armor nor the new bound weapons being lootable, the only thing they will drop anymore is their Daedra heart. In vanilla they also drop an Iron Dagger (why, Todd?) which I removed. Dremora will now also turn into ash piles upon their death.\n<br />\n<br />In addition to MLU's Bound Bow, Arrows, Sword and Battleaxe, there is now a Bound Dagger for Dremora warlocks so they have a melee weapon to fall back on after depleting their Magicka. I also added three different tiers of each Bound weapon. Weapons of the lowest are damage-wise on par with their Dwarven equivalents, the second with Glass, the third with Daedric. This still increases the Dremora's damage in lower levels compared to Vanilla, however the player shouldn't really encounter them early on anyway. With those three tiers, there is still some scaling with the player for the sake of balancing (but it's not noticeable in normal gameplay as those weapons look identical and cannot be looted). Note that the stats match the changes from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994]Weapons, Armor, Clothing, and Clutter Fixes[/url] (you can read more about them [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/613]here[/url]).\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]REQUIREMENTS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]COMPATIBILITY[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />A patch for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466]Audio Overhaul for Skyrim[/url] is included in the FOMOD installer.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]CHANGELOG[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />[b]1.0[/b] Initial release.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]FUTURE PLANS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />- Add some other type of valuable loot (since right now you only get Daedra Hearts from Dremora).\n<br />- Add higher level varieties of Dremora (similar to what High Level Enemies does).\n<br />- Potentially use custom red variants of the Bound weapons (no clue how to do that though).\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#6f9dba]NO FORTIFY CRAFTING[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />[spoiler][size=3][color=#adceff][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />In vanilla Skyrim it's pretty easy to abuse smithing, enchanting, and alchemy to gain huge amounts of gold and experience as well as totally throw off balancing by crafting equipment with increasingly ridiculous stats. This is a brute force fix and balance tweak:\n<br />\n<br />- You will no longer find Fortify Smithing or Fortify Enchanting potions in Skyrim.\n<br />- You will no longer find Fortify Smithing or Fortify Alchemy enchanted items (gloves, helmets, jewellery) in Skyrim.\n<br />- Artifacts with Fortify Smithing enchantments (The Forgemaster's Fingers, Silver-Blood Family Ring) can no longer be disenchanted.\n<br />- Artifacts with Fortify Alchemy enchantments (Muiri's Ring, Ring of Pure Mixtures) can no longer be disenchanted.\n<br />- These artifacts (which retain their enchantments) are now quite a bit more unique and valuable.\n<br />\n<br />This is a feature from ChocolateNoodle's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2262]Skyrim Alchemy Fixed[/url] that I snipped out. This was done because I dislike some other SAF features (the new ingredients) and prefer to use skepmanmods' [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5877]Alchemy Potions and Food Tweaks[/url] which does basically everything SAF does and a good deal more. I just liked the quick fix of removing Fortify Smithing/Enchanting/Alchemy so I created this standalone version to use alongside skepman's overhaul.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]REQUIREMENTS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994]Weapons, Armor, Clothng and Clutter Fixes[/url] (soft requirement; forwarded some values)\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]CREDITS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />ChocolateNoodle for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2262]Skyrim Alchemy Fixed[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]CHANGELOG[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />[b]1.1[/b] Fixed artifacts STILL being disenchantable due to templates (thanks SimonMagus!).\n<br />[b]1.1[/b] Removed edit to one ring that isn't even in the game (bit of a facepalm moment here).\n<br />[b]1.1[/b] Renamed mod and plugin (!) to No Fortify Crafting.\n<br />[b]1.0[/b] Initial release.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#6f9dba]SCROLL OF FIERCELY ROASTING[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />[spoiler][size=3][color=#adceff][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />This scroll is actually a Morrowind easter egg, it was [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:The_Scroll_of_Fiercely_Roasting]part of a quest[/url]. Morrowloot Ultimate adds one scroll to a specific location in Skyrim and that's really all this tiny plugin does. Open the spoiler below to find out where exactly you can find the scroll.\n<br />\n<br />[b]LOCATION[/b]\n<br />[spoiler]The scroll can be found inside Rannveig's Fast.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]REQUIREMENTS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />None.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]CHANGELOG[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />[b]1.0[/b] Initial release.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/l1itUFP.png[/img][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#ffb652]UNSUPPORTED[/color] [color=#6f9dba]ANCIENT NORD HERO WEAPONS[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />[spoiler][size=3][color=#adceff][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />This is a standalone version of the new Ancient Nordic Hero Weapons introduced by Morrowloot. In order to reduce the amount of Ebony found in the world, Morrowloot adds a new (incomplete) set of weapons that are similar in strength to the Ebony weapons. They can only be found on Draugr bosses (EncDraugr05).\n<br />\n<br />[b]A much better implementation of a similar feature can be found in the Hybrid Loot module.[/b] Instead of adding a new set, WACCF distributed the previously crafting-only Nord Hero weapons to high-level draugr. This was expanded in Hybrid Loot so that draugr bosses drop no Ebony equipment at all.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]NEW WEAPONS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />- Ancient Nordic Hero Arrows\n<br />- Ancient Nordic Hero Bow\n<br />- Ancient Nordic Hero Sword\n<br />- Ancient Nordic Hero Greatsword\n<br />- Ancient Nordic Hero War Axe\n<br />- Ancient Nordic Hero Battleaxe\n<br />\n<br />Value was increased across the board as the weapons were quite cheap in comparison. All Ancient Nord Hero weapons now have slightly less damage and the same Crit Damage as their Ebony counterparts. The weight of all Ancient Nord Hero Weapons was slightly increased so that they are only slightly lighter than their Ebony counterparts.\n<br />\n<br />There are four unique enchanted variants (with Frost enchantments). All unenchanted versions can be tempered with one corundum ingot (requires Arcane Smithing). Visually they are identical to the vanilla [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Skyforge#Draugr_Weapons]Nord Hero[/url] weapons.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]DISTRIBUTION[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />The weapons have their own (sub) levelled lists which were added to the Draugr templates. Five vanilla levelled lists were altered as well. Some of the weapons are placed in different places of the world (occasionally with a matching piece of armor), including the four unique enchanted variants. Open the spoiler below to check where exactly the weapons were placed.\n<br />\n<br />[b]LOCATIONS[/b]\n<br />[spoiler]Deepwood Reboubt: Ancient Nord Hero Battleaxe of Frost\n<br />Forelhost Crypt: Ancient Nord Hero Bow, Ancient Nord Armor\n<br />Volskygge Passages: Ancient Nord Hero Greatsword, Ancient Nord Hero Sword of Frost\n<br />Valthume: Ancient Nord Hero War Axe\n<br />Valthume Vestibule: Ancient Nord Hero War Axe of Frost, Ancient Nord Armor\n<br />Labyrinthian Tower. Ancient Nord Hero Greatsword of Frost\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]MY TWEAKS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />Basically I stripped out all relevant edits from Morrowloot Ultimate and then made the following edits:\n<br />- Changed the unique, enchanted variant of the Ancient Nordic Hero Greatsword to Frost (instead of Inferno). Since the other three enchanted versions all have Frost enchantments and the weapons themselves are supposed to be ancient nordic artifacts I thought it was more fitting.\n<br />- LItemDraugr05Weapon1HShield still had an Ebony shield, I changed this to Ancient Nord Hero Shield as intended.\n<br />- Reverted tiny height changes to some of the EncDraugr05 templates (most likely an unintended, wild edit).\n<br />- Changed stats for most Ancient Nord Hero weapons.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]REQUIREMENTS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994]Weapons, Armor, Clothng and Clutter Fixes[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]CHANGELOG[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />[b]1.0[/b] Initial release.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#adceff][b]FUTURE PLANS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />- Use a modder's resource to give the Ancient Nord Hero Weapons a unique appearance.\n<br />- Possibly slightly increase the stats of the enchanted versions and give them unique names.\n<br />- Add generic enchanted versions of the regular weapons.[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/l1itUFP.png[/img][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#adceff][b]FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Why did you remove the Better Ancient Knowledge Perk module?[/b]\n<br />I didn't! It was simply moved to another mod page of mine which is a better fit - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38348]Miscellaneous Tweaks Collection[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#adceff][b]COMPLEMENTARY MODS[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />All the mods listed below are recommended to be used with any of the Morrowloot Miscellania modules. For some of them, WACCF and CCOR are hard requirements. Together they are meant to offer a similar experience but more refined, specialised and modular.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994]Weapons, Armor, Clothing and Clutter Fixes[/url]\n<br />Weapon and armor rebalancing, changes much the same things as MLU, assigns proper vanilla and custom keywords, tweaks and rebalances damage, weight and value for many items.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487]Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul[/url]\n<br />There are plenty overhauls for encounter zones out there, but this is the one I recommend. It's close enough to vanilla to not make the early game or Alternate Start playthroughs frustratingly hard, but also expands the level caps beyond the pathetic vanilla ones. Simon used an interesting system to determine the level ranges of encounter zones based on enemy type and quest involvement. They are a lot more forgiving than MLU's encounter zones.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9138]Zim's Immersive Artifacts[/url]\n<br />Includes unique Thane weapons and other artifacts, improved enchantments, adds unique appearances to some items and occasionally a unique name when items had a generic one. Modular. (MLU also makes the Thane weapons more unique and gives them better names, plus gives many unique artifacts increased stats and unique effects, however ZIA is a lot more consistent and changes all of them instead of only a few.)\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#adceff][b]SUPPORT[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />I made Morrowloot Miscellania primarily for inclusion in my guide, The Phoenix Flavour. There will be no patches or other support for the time being, but you are of course welcome to all the files, change them, tweak them, create your own patches, whatever.
