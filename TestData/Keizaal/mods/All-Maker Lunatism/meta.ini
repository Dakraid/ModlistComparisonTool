nexusDescription="Every time your Skyrim alter-ego sleeps on Solstheim before the certain stage of the Dragonborn DLC main quest he or she have a chance to fall under an influence of one of the All-Maker stones. And while this feature adds an extra depth into the plot, it is also a bit of annoyance. Especially if you have an Alternate Start type of mod and decided to begin your game on Solstheim. And even more so in Survival mode.\n<br />\n<br />My first thoght about it was to disable the feature entirely. But this would mean to sacrifice part of the story which is not good.\n<br />\n<br />After some digging within Construction Kit I found another way to approach this. Now whenever your character is supposed to do some construction routine he or she will end up at the nearest All-Maker stone instead of a random one.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />P. S.\n<br />Special thanks to\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/39501725?tab=about+me]Parapets[/url]\xfeff for bug reports and fixing advises."
