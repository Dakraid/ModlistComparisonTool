nexusDescription="[font=Arial][color=#9fc5e8][size=4][size=5]Why Diverse Skyrim Causes the Scene to break:[/size]\n<br />[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3]In Skyrim, when a scene is playing there are different \"phases\".[/size][/font][font=Arial][size=3] The scene will not progress to the next phase until all of the actions in the current phase are complete. \n<br />\n<br />In this case, there are several \"actions\" where soldiers are supposed to cheer after each of Rikke's/Balgruuf's lines, which do not get completed. [/size][/font][font=Arial][size=3]As you can imagine, if even a single NPC cant complete their action, it will cause the entire scene to lock up.[/size][/font][font=Arial][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />You may be thinking \"Diverse Skyrim doesn't touch the scene, there should be no reason it would keep the NPC's from completing their cheer lines\" just as I did when I first heard about this issue.[/size][/font][font=Arial][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />However, you do not need to directly touch the scene or Rikke/Balgruuf to break it. The issue is that many of the new NPC's have different voice types than the vanilla soldier NPCs (for example, the orc guards or soldiers). These new NPC's don't have the correct voice type with the appropriate lines needed to complete their cheer action. \n<br />The game waits on them to cheer before Rikke can continue her lines, but they never do it because they can't.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/font][font=Arial][size=3]So, I simply added a condition to the vanilla AI package to check the voice type before trying to run the package. This means that soldiers that can cheer will and soldiers that cannot cheer will not try to.\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Installation:[/color]\n<br />Just install with any mod manager. Load order is pretty much irrelevant. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Permissions:\n<br />[/color]This file [b]does not[/b] edit any part of Diverse Skyrim. Its simply an edit of a vanilla AI package. \n<br />In the event that [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/13372700]CEMN[/url] would like to integrate this fix into Diverse Skyrim, I will point people that direction instead.[/size][/font]"
