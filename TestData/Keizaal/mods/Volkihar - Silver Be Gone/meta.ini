Doesn\x2019t it burn their tongs and lips? Did Volkihar Clan members developed resistance to silver? \n<br />I don\x2019t think so, hence I\x2019ve made this little mod, which replaces the \n<br />silver clutter from Volkihar Keep. It comes in two variants, A) bronze \n<br />and B) red/iron.\n<br />\n<br />Incidentally, I\x2019ve also restored the vanilla blood decal texture (only for the three bloodied silver items from \n<br />Dawnguard DLC) which got replaced by the otherwise fabulous Enhanced \n<br />Blood Textures mod. Can\x2019t play vampire without EBT, but those red banded\n<br /> goblets drove me nuts.\n<br />\n<br />And while at it, I\x2019ve replaced some of the bloody bones on tables with human hearts because I like to think \n<br />that vampires eat better than dogs do.\n<br />\n<br />That\x2019s all the mod does. Enjoy!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]: \n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The mod makes small edits in Volkihar Keep interior, there's a slight \n<br />chance using it in combination with other mods changing the same cell will arise issues. (usually solved by changing the load order)[*]It also edits DLC1SilverGobletBlood01, DLC1SilverGobletBlood01, DLC1SilverJugBlood01 models.\xa0 \n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />Note: You may occasionally notice some vampire NPC still drinking from a \n<br />silver goblet. Yes, it annoys me, but I won\x2019t change that idle unless I \n<br />figure out exactly how many non-vampire NPCs are using it.\xa0 \n<br />\n<br />[b]Credits:[/b] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24883]The_Funktasm[/url]"
