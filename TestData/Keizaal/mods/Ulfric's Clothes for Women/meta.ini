nexusDescription="Ulfric's clothes, when worn in game by female characters, simply look identical to a fur-trimmed cloak, fine armguards, and pleated shoes. This mod changes that. The main issue in it is in part fixed by\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994]Weapons, Armor, Clothing and Clutter Fixes[/url], which offers an alternative similar in appearance to the [b]Classic[/b] version of this mod. I don't use WACCF, however, due to the number of non-optional tweaks it makes, so if you don't use WACCF or would like a different look or gauntlet and boot remesh compatibility (conceding that I do not know of [i]any [/i]mod that remeshes Ulfric's boots and bracers), then this is the mod for you! The original\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27673]Ulfric's Clothes for Women[/url] is awesome, but I thought that it could use a few more options and a Special Edition port. We've also got some BodySlide data for CBBE (offered here by yours truly) and now, thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/29201655]OceanDotEye[/url], for BHUNP [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43449]over here[/url]! \n<br />\n<br />The comparison shot shows the three configurations offered by default in my mod \x2013 [b]Classic[/b], as it was in the original; [b]Retextured[/b], which offers alternate textures; and [b]Reshaped[/b], where Ulfric's clothes have been fit\xa0 to the female body. You can choose between these, or you can mix and match if you'd really like. If you do end up using the [b]Retextured[/b] version, be sure to download the [b]Improved Bracer Textures,[/b] also available from the files tab.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Compatibility[/b][/size]\n<br />The [b]Retextured[/b] version will be compatible with any remeshes using the base game's textures, the [b]Reshaped [/b]version will be compatible with any retextures using the base game's meshes . . . you get the idea. The[b] Classic [/b]version, which changes the [i]meshes[/i] of the bracers and boots and the [i]textures[/i] of the clothes will thus be compatible with [i]rextextures [/i]of the bracers and boots, and [i]remeshes[/i] of the clothes.\n<br />\n<br />The mod\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4703]Rustic Clothing[/url] includes a retexture for the version offered by WACCF and it is compatible with this mod out of the box \x2013 you can let it overwrite ulfricf.dds and ulfricf_n.dds. It does not retexture the female bracers or boots, but this is only a factor in the [b]Retextured[/b] version.\n<br />\n<br />I would not recommend using the [b]Classic [/b]version of this mod with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994]Weapons, Armor, Clothing and Clutter Fixes[/url], as WACCF contains essentially the same change by default. It is highly likely that the [b]Retextured [/b]and [b]Reshaped[/b] versions of this mod will require patches, so if anyone needs that, let me know and I will provide one.\n<br />\n<br />The [b]Classic[/b] and [b]Retextured[/b] versions are probably compatible by default with any skimpy remeshes. You could still use the [b]Reshaped [/b]version but I feel like some point would be missed there.\n<br />\n<br />Can't really think of any other compatibility issues you might have. The change this mod makes is fairly minor, anyhow."
