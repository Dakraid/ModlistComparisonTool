nexusDescription="[b][size=5]Notice: This mod requires SKSE!\xfeff[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]What is Atronach Friendly Fire?[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Atronach Friendly Fire is a simple mod that makes it so that friendly conjured atronachs will heal from your spells that have the same element - so Fire atronachs will heal from fire spells, frost atronachs will heal from frost spells and so on. Furthermore, friendly atronachs will no longer turn hostile when hit by a spell of the same attribute![/size]\n<br />[size=4][b]\n<br />What about compatibility?[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Actually, compatibility has been my number one priority while making this mod. As of right now, Atronach Friendly Fire does not edit a single vanilla record. Furthermore, I went the extra mile and decided to also support Atronachs from other mods - such as Poison Atronachs from Elemental Destruction Magic and Shadow Atronachs from Shadow Spell Package.\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]What modded Atronachs does this support and how exactly?[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Currently, this mod supports Atronachs from 4 other mods: Arcanum, Elemental Destruction Magic, Shadow Spell Package, and VIGILANT. The easiest to explain are the ones from Arcanum and VIGILANT. Arcanum adds 3 variants of \"Archons\" - special atronachs summoned by merging two atronachs of the same type. Incandescent Archon will heal from fire spells, Brumal Archons will heal from frost spells, and Tempestuous Archons will heal from shock spells. VIGILANT adds 5 unique Flame Atronach variants - Flame Lords, Flame Lurkers, Flame Queens, and Flame Spirits. They will all heal from fire spells. Shadow Spell Package adds\xa0 Shadow Atronachs who will heal from the mod's shadow spells, along with shadow spells from Triumvirate - Mage Archetypes. However, shadow atronachs are NOT immune to shadow magick... so they'll still take damage. Fixing this is outside the mod's scope. Elemental Destruction Magic adds 4 new atronach types - Wind, Water, Earth, and Poison Atronachs. They will each receive healing from their respective elements and Poison Atronachs will receive healing from poison spells.\xa0\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b][size=4]I found a mod that adds some really cool new Atronachs/Spells, can you include it?\xa0[/size][/b]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />Sure. Leave a comment in the discussion tab and I'll get around to it. Eventually. Bear in mind that each of these updates will require a new save.[/size]"
