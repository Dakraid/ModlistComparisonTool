nexusDescription="[size=2][left][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/98850/?tab=description]LE VERSION[/url][/size][/left][/size][size=2][u][b]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/u][color=#6d9eeb][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/color]\n<br />[/size][size=2]\n<br />Customize plenty of options such as starting location, items and spells. Skip the opening sequence and bypass the first [size=2]few chapters[/size] of the main questline. Optionally, play as a non-dragonborn, completely avoiding the main quest.\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Skyrim Unbound Reborn is an\xa0[size=2]updated and significantly reworked[/size] version of \xfeff[/size][size=2][size=2][size=2][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6532]Skyrim Unbound[/url][/size][/size][/size] (i continue to improve it). [size=2][size=2] In addition to fixes and updates, most of the starting options are reworked according to my vision, the quest part and the start procedure are changed too.[size=2] Main changes:[/size][/size][/size][size=2]\n<br />[spoiler][color=#6d9eeb][b]Fixes[/b][/color]\n<br />[size=2]- Patched for USSEP and Dawnguard (Durnehviir will not be resurrected if you can't learn shouts, disabled the imperial deserter dialogue);[/size]\n<br />- Conditioned dragons-, shouts- and dragonborn-related loading screens and \"Farmer refugees after dragon attack\" WE quest;\n<br />- Removed unnecessary ITMs;\n<br />- Fixed some bugs (added new ones as well). The ones i remember:\n<br />&gt; controls enabling a lot later than the titles end on SE\n<br />&gt; some werewolf variables not set when making werewolf\n<br />&gt; Roggvir execution scene requiring you to walk near gates in order to start when you start in Solitude\n<br />&gt; Volsung not appearing from his sarcophagus for non-dragonborn players\n<br />&gt; blur effect from the cart intro playing when you're south of Helgen for the first time\n<br />&gt; random dragons not appearing until you reach level 10, regardless of the MCM settings\n<br />&gt; some MCM bugs\n<br />&gt; floating start location markers so you fall when you're teleported\n<br />&gt; soldiers inviting you to join their faction even if you selected that faction in Skyrim Unbound;\n<br />[size=2][size=2][size=2]- Non-dragonborn players don't have to come very close to the word wall in Bleak Falls Barrow in order to trigger the boss;[/size][/size][/size]\n<br />[size=2][size=2][size=2]- Balgruuf is not made a player's friend at the game start;[/size][/size][/size]\n<br />- Dragons delay quest optimized.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][b]Quests[/b][/color]\n<br />- Changed the way you become a thane of Whiterun: a standard thaneship quest (help the people of the hold and buy a house) will be avialable after you complete The Blessings of Nature quest and the Gildergreen blooms. No Breezehome price change;\n<br />- Remade the changes to Stormcloaks/Imperials joining dialogues to avoid logic and immersion problems;\n<br />[size=2]- Added an immersive delay between absorbing your first dragon soul and the Greybeard's call;\n<br />- The Whiterun Watchtower is not broken (the dialogues about dragons attacking it were already cut anyway);\n<br />- \"Shout - learn about word wall\" WI quest (a \"Letter from a friend\" about a word wall) disabled for non-dragonborn characters with shouts enabled, instead of editing the letter text;[/size]\n<br />- Disabled Delphina's dialogue \"You're that visitor, been pokin' around.\";\n<br />- Conflict-free Golden Claw quest edits.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][b]Game Start[/b][/color]\n<br />\xfeff- Swap Gear option after the character creation, which was previously only avialable in the quick start mode;\n<br />[size=2][size=2]- The Helgen corridor is replaced with a custom starting room;[/size][/size]\n<br />[size=2]\xfeff- The intro titles are half as short by default (but can be changed to full ones);\n<br />- The load of notifications is hidden during the first stage of the game start;\n<br />- You can use a hotkey instead of the Begin Your Adventure option;[/size]\n<br />- No journal entries at the start;\n<br />- You can make SU first in the MCM list.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][b]Presets\n<br />[/b][color=#ffffff][size=2]- A custom preset system. The old predefined presets are removed.[/size][/color][b]\n<br />\n<br />Character options[/b][/color]\n<br />- Set a bounty on your head in the hold where you start, set the bounty on your head if you start in jail so you have some time to serve;\n<br />- Forsworn faction is removed due to issues with it;\n<br />- Bandit faction is removed in favor of local faction integrated into new locations;\n<br />- The Imperial/Stormcloak faction is now controlled by Aggressive Enemy Soldiers option. This option can be used not only when starting as an Imperial/Stormcloak, but also can be enabled from the start and will start working if you join Imperials/Stormcloaks normally.

You can choose a season or a month.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][b]Extension Framework\n<br />[/b][color=#ffffff]- A framework that allows users to create addons.[/color][b]\n<br />\n<br />Other[/b][/color]\n<br />- Removed Non-SkyUI support and some useless options;\n<br />[size=2]- Dragon Stalking Fix is no longer included[/size];\n<br />- Compatible with Experience. [/size][/size][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2]Some patches provided in a FOMOD-installer. Native addons for Usable Lantern and Alchemist's Journal.[/size][/size][/size] Some addons created using the framework.[/spoiler][/size]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=2][size=2][color=#6d9eeb][b]GAME START[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />1. Open Skyrim Unbound MCM (may need some time to appear on heavy modlists) and [size=2][size=2]customize settings as you want[/size][/size].[/size][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2] All options have descriptions displayed at the bottom when you highlight an option. [/size][/size][/size]Pay attention to the Dragon Souls option on the first page, it defines if you're the Dragonborn or not (random by default).[/size]\n<br />\n<br />2. Click the Begin Your Adventure option (the first option on the first MCM page) or press the hotkey\xa0[size=2]when you're not in a menu[/size] (set on the last MCM page, Enter by default).\n<br />\n<br />3. You get to the starting room, the character creation menu is opened. After you close it, you will be given a choice:\n<br />[size=2][b]Continue [/b]- Start the game;\n<br />[b]Swap Gear[/b] - Re-add all the items (which can give you a different result) and open the character creation menu again;\n<br />[b]Stay Here[/b] - Stay in the starting room. Press the hotkey to choose an action: Continue, Swap Gear or Open RaceMenu. Choose Continue or use the[size=2] first MCM option again[/size] to start the game.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />4. Your adventure begins with no quests in your journal.\n<br />\n<br />Note: there's no vanilla start option.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][size=2][size=2][color=#6d9eeb][b]DRAGONS AND MAIN QUEST[/b][/color][/size][/size]\n<br />\n<br />The game begins with no dragons, Skyrim Unbound delays them depending on the MCM settings. By default, dragons at word walls appear after a week or two of in-game time. After another week or so, dragons start to appear randomly. In the MCM you can customize the delay and choose between timed and leveled modes.\n<br />\n<br />The first few chapters of the main questline are bypassed, meaning you no longer have to obtain the Dragonstone for Farengar or defeat Mirmulnir for the Jarl of Whiterun. When you absorb a dragon soul for the first time, you'll be summoned to High Hrothgar by the Greybeards after a while. The first word of the Unrelenting Force will be learned automatically after this, or you can find it earlier in Bleak Falls Barrow.\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Skyrim Unbound allows you to play as a non-dragonborn, without shouts, absorbing dragon souls and playing the main quest (including the main quest of Dragonborn DLC). The Civil War can be finished without encountering dragons or being Dragonborn.[/size]\n<br />[/size][size=2]\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][b]\n<br />WHITERUN THANESHIP[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The way you can become a thane of Whiterun is different. Complete The Blessings of Nature quest and talk to Jarl Balgruuf when the Gildergreen tree is repaired/the sappling blooms. He'll thank you and allow you to buy the Breezehome, and the standard thaneship quest (help people of the hold and buy a house to become a thane) will be avialable.[/size][size=2]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=2][size=2][size=3][b][color=#6d9eeb][size=2]INSTALLATION[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][size=2]Requires [url=https://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url] (any modern version), [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604]SkyUI[/url], and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]USSEP[/url].[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13048]\n<br />PapyrusUtil[/url] is a soft requirement for addons, presets, general settings and SkyrimUnbound.json.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854]powerofthree's Papyrus Extender[/url] is a soft requirement for standing stone descriptions in the MCM.\n<br />\n<br />Install with your mod-manager.\n<br />I'm still working on this, so click \"Track\" at the top of the page.[/size][/size][/size][/size][size=2][size=2] Check[size=2][size=3][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2] \xfeff[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/1470]Compatibility[/url],\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/1489]FAQ[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/3104]Common Issues and Troubleshooting[/url] articles.
