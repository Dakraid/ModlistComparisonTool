nexusDescription="[color=#9fc5e8][b][center][size=5]Adamant - A Perk Overhaul\xa0[/size][/center][/b][/color]\n<br />Adamant is a complete overhaul of Skyrim\x2019s perk trees designed to balance existing skills and add powerful new perks to the game. It thoroughly overhauls the game\x2019s skill trees in order to provide the player with compelling choices and smooth progression from start to finish. While Adamant does increase the total number of perks in the game by a small amount, it avoids bloat, sprawl, and power creep by balancing its selection of perks around Vanilla perk gains. Like many modern perk overhauls, it provides support for popular gameplay styles that are underutilized in the Vanilla game, such as shouts, staves, and unarmed combat.\n<br />\n<br />In order to build off my previous work, Adamant requires\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839?tab=description&amp;BH=2]Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul[/url]\xa0to be installed. This allows me to introduce new perks to support spells such as Viperbolt, Reflective Light, and Silence in the most straightforward way possible.\n<br />\n<br />Adamant can be expanded with the optional\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790]Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon[/url]\xa0that merges Lockpicking and Pickpocket into a single tree, Security, and then adds a standalone Hand to Hand tree. This addon requires [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444]Address Library for SKSE Plugins[/url]\xa0[/b]and is compatible with pre-AE and post-AE versions of Skyrim.\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=5][b]Perks[/b]\xa0[/size][/color][color=#e06666]\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[color=#93c47d][size=4][b]Alchemy\xa0[/b][/size][/color][color=#a2c4c9]\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[color=#93c47d][i]Alchemy is the art of brewing magical potions and deadly poisons.[/i][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][b][Spoiler]Herbalist (10/50):[/b] Potions and poisons you make are 25/50% stronger.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]Intensity (30/70):[/b] Poisons last two/four additional hits.\n<br />[b]Solvency (60/90):[/b] Poisons you mix are 25/50% stronger.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Concentration (30/70):[/b] Potions last 50/100% longer.\n<br />[b]Potency (60/90): [/b]Potions you mix are 25% stronger.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Experimenter (20): [/b]Eating an ingredient reveals all of its effects.\n<br />[b]Green Thumb (40/80):[/b] You gather one/two extra ingredients from plants. \xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]Chemist (100):[/b] Create twice as many potions and poisons from the same number of ingredients.[/spoiler][/color][color=#93c47d]\n<br />[b][i]Notes:\xa0\n<br />[/i][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][i]Leveling alchemy generally reduces the tedium involved in using the skill.[/i]\n<br />[*][i]Crafted poisons and potions will be at the same strength as Vanilla.[/i]\n<br />[*][i]Potion duration and poison use perks affect looted potions and poisons as well.[/i]\n<br />[/list][/color]\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4][b]Alteration\xa0[/b][/size]\n<br />[/color][color=#6fa8dc]\n<br />[i]The School of Alteration governs the manipulation of the physical world.

However, my preferred solution for unarmed combat is\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790]Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon[/url]. This mod\xa0merges Lockpicking and Pickpocket into a single tree, Security, and then adds a standalone Hand to Hand tree. It also makes several changes to Light and Heavy Armor, and comes with several optional addons that make further improvements to those trees. This addon requires\xa0[b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444]Address Library for SKSE Plugins[/url]\xa0[/b]and is compatible with pre-AE and post-AE versions of Skyrim. I strongly recommend this mod to everyone who uses Adamant!\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=5]Adamant - Smithing Addon[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />The Vanilla tempering system frontloads the tempering system's power, causing the player to deal too much damage with too little investment into Smithing. Unfortunately, due to a combination of engine limitations and the constraints of my project, Adamant makes this issue a little worse than Vanilla. To address this, I've added an optional plugin that uses\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27776]Improvement Names Customized SSE[/url]\xa0to split the Vanilla tempering system from six\xfeff tiers into ten. These tiers use traditional RPG-style upgrade named (+1, +2, +3, etc). The base damage of a +10 weapon is increased by 10 points (equal to Vanilla Legendary). The base Armor Rating of a +10 non-chest piece of armor is increased by 15 points (50% higher than Vanilla Legendary). The base Armor Rating of a chest piece is increased by 30 points (50% higher than Vanilla Legendary).\n<br />\n<br />You can temper an item to +1 from the beginning of the game. You gain the ability to temper up to one additional tier at 40, 60, 80, and 100 Smithing, for a total of +5. Then, Adamant's five tempering perks each provide one additional tier, allowing you to reach +10. Tempering items also gives significantly more XP.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Although it is not possible to advance beyond +10 with Apothecary and Thaumaturgy installed (since they close the crafting loop), Adamant - Plus Ten Smithing does support tiers up to +20 for users who keep the crafting loop in their game. Supporting further tiers requires a simple edit to a .json.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5][color=#9fc5e8]Adamant - Talos Addon[/color]\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />This tiny plugin changes the bonuses to the Shrine of Talos and the Amulet of Talos to be more balanced when combined with Adamant's perks. This plugin is intended for those who don't wish to use Pilgrim.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][Spoiler][/b]\n<br />[b]Blessing of Talos - [/b]Your shout damage is increased by 25%.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Amulet of Talos -[/b] Your shout damage is increased by 25%.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=5][b]General Changes[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Adamant makes a few changes to general game mechanics in order to support its changes to perks. I have altered several game settings relating to bartering, pickpocket, and magic, including dual casting. In Vanilla, dual casting a spell increases its magnitude or duration by 2.2x, and increases its cost by 2.8x. In Adamant, dual casting a spell increases its magnitude or duration by 2.5x, and increases its cost by 3.0x.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />In addition, I have removed several Vanilla perks and given them to the player automatically. This means that the player starts with access to a few more mechanics than they would in Vanilla. A comprehensive list of these perks is included below.\xa0\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][Spoiler][/b]Alteration Dual Casting\n<br />Conjuration Dual Casting\n<br />Destruction Dual Casting\xa0\n<br />Illusion Dual Casting\n<br />Restoration Dual Casting\n<br />Arcane Blacksmith\xa0\xa0\n<br />Critical Charge\n<br />Greater Critical Charge\n<br />Power Bash\xa0\n<br />Eagle Eye\xa0\n<br />Rune Master\xa0\n<br />Summoner\n<br />Physician\xa0\n<br />Intimidation\xa0\n<br />Bribery\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f4f4f4][i]If you see any of these perks in your game, you have a conflict in your load order.[/i][/spoiler][/color]\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=5]Compatibility\xa0[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Adamant prioritizes compatibility wherever it can. In a few places, however, conflicts are unavoidable. Notably, some combat overhauls might make changes to the same game settings that Adamant does. In addition, crafting and smithing mods almost inevitably must conflict with Adamant, since many of the most popular mods (including WACCF and CCOR) make direct changes to the perk trees. For my part, I have only touched crafting recipes when I felt it was absolutely necessary to create a coherent progression in the perk tree.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />In addition, Adamant requires Mysticism and thus inherits its compatibility profile. This is largely a non-issue, since magic mods typically require patches for perk mods anyway. I have taken steps to make those compatibility patches as painless as possible: in most cases, they will simply require a keyword to be added to relevant spells.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=5][b]My Other Mods[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686]Aetherius - A Race Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411]Mundus - A Standing Stone Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839]Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191]Adamant - A Perk Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487]Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549]Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639]Scion - A Vampire Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746]Manbeast - A Werewolf Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130]Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099]Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul\xa0\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138]Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul\n<br />[/url][/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790][size=2]Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon[/size][/url]"
