However lumber production has slowed down significantly due to the ever prideful inhabitants leaving to fight for the Stormcloaks. Now the old worker house lies abandoned.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][img]https://i.imgur.com/pSMU5mj.jpg[/img]\xfeff[/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[b]The Great Village of Mixwater Mill\n<br />[/b]The Great Village of Mixwater Mill is a small overhaul. It replaces the vanilla farmhouses and lumber mill with new custom meshes and adds a new familiy of proud (though bigoted) Nord farmers. The custom meshes are part of the Eastmarch farmhouse set. The buildings are in a Nordic style with sod roofs.\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />[/size][size=5][b]Compatibility[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]The custom structures in this mod use vanilla textures and are compatible with texture overhauls. I personally use Noble Skyrim 2k as can be seen in the screenshots.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3]This mod is not compatible with any mod that significantly alters the area around Mixwater Mill or it's interiors.[/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/10182460?tab=user+files]Find my other mods here![/url]\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />I don't have a lot to offer but if you like my work and are interested in supporting me I have a Patreon :)\n<br />[size=6][url=https://www.patreon.com/Archinatic][color=#ff7700]Patreon[/color][/url][/size][/size][size=5]\xfeff[/size][/center][center][size=5][/size][/center]"
