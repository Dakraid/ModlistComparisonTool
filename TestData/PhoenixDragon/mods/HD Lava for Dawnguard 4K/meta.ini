nexusDescription="[u][b][size=4]Description:[/size][/b][/u]\r<br />Surprisingly nobody did it before.\r<br />The very low resolution of the lava texture (actually it&#39;s a shader effect) used in Dawnguard always bothering me...\r<br />So I decided to try to improve it a bit.\r<br />\r<br />The resolution used here is 4k. Vanilla was 512 but it was very likely just an upscaled 256 texture... (So it&#39;s 8 time larger now).\r<br />Since It&#39;s mainly (only ?) used in interior and the texture is compressed, you shouldn&#39;t notice any performance drop.\r<br />\r<br />You can see the texture in the Aetherium Forge\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=4]2.0 Update:[/size]\r<br />[/b][/u]The new version is available in 4k and in 2k. Use the 2k version only if you have a low end PC (even in 4k, it&#39;s still less demanding than any other regular 4k texture).\r<br />The new version should look better...\r<br />Keep in mind I did it primarily for myself and I didn&#39;t spend a lot of time on it, but I though other people can enjoy it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Installation:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Just drag and drop in you Skyrim folder or use NMM as usual.\r<br />Compatible with everything since I couldn&#39;t find any other mod which change this particular texture (reason why I did it).\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Credit:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />TheMinecraftianGamer for its work on the original lava texture, kudos to him :)"
