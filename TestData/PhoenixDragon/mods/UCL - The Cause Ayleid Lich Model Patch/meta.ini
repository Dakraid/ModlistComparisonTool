Transformation now takes ~1 second instead of 5-10 seconds.\n<br />\n<br />-Reading the \"Barrows of the Mountains\" book now lets you travel in and out of Dragontail Mountain. In the base mod, the location is only accessible by fast travel.\n<br />\n<br />-Rewrote quest scripts to remove unneeded usage of OnUpdate() loops; improved performance and stability (lower likelihood of questlines breaking)\xa0\n<br />\n<br />-Other script optimizations where relevant\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed many issues related to the shade of the revenant; rewrote entire feature.\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed bug where undeath passive was applied twice in lich form, causing resist frost and fire weakness to double their intended value.\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed interaction that can cause constant health drain, because certain passive effects were set to a health value modifier with 0 magnitude.\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed blackface with undeath npcs due to facegen not being generated.\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed Arkay The Enemy quest not completing if you choose to free the priest (Ironically this is the quest choice that locks the player out of the lich path)\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed bug where Unbind Soul FX is stuck on player after ritual due to rogue equipability on unbind soul.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed broker message being stuck in quest log.\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed broker shack cell being enterable before you receive her quest.\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed item ownership and npcs respawning in ravernscorn spire\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed dragon priests being invisible in coffin due to wild edit to dragon priest race in undeath.esp\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed undeath overwriting USSEP fixed scripts because the mod packaged base game scripts into the mod by mistake.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed undeath bug where Priest of Arkay spawns in standing because his sit marker is occupied by a necromancer.\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed players not getting a proper lich model and being stuck as a shade (this is a rare bug that only happens when players completely break questline scripts)\n<br />\n<br />-Staff of the Worm Lord is now acquirable - defeat the lich in Scourg Barrow to obtain the artifact.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />-Staff of the Worm Lord has a unique mesh and textures courtesy of HeirOfTheSeptims.\n<br />\n<br />-Lich change spell animation sped up from taking 3 seconds to less than 1 second.\n<br />\n<br />-The lich ritual now gives you a debug notification when you attempt it as a vampire to prevent confusion.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />-Lich ritual now enables soul cairn access.\n<br />\n<br />-Necromantic Altar requirements changed from 100 Enchanting to 50 Enchanting and 75 conjuration by default. Skill requirements are configurable in the MCM.\n<br />\n<br />-DLC dragon priest masks now visible in lich form, including Miraak's Mask\n<br />\n<br />-Lich transformation will now remember staffs equipped on either hand, instead of just the right hand. If you had a staff on both hands, the right hand staff will take priority.\n<br />\n<br />-The broker will always sell black pearls needed for the ritual, rather than 50% of the time. The broker will also stock some a few other items required for ritual recipes.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />-Alchemist chest during the \"Infernal Alchemy\" quest now contains a deathbell required to make Namira's Corrosion.\n<br />\n<br />-Dark Pact effect simplified and fixed. Original effect was broken both mechanically and in terms of balance. Instead of additional summons, Dark Pact now grants increased damage to the living, at the cost of taking increased damage from the living.\n<br />\n<br />-Fixed enemies respawning in Ravernscorn Spire\n<br />\n<br />-Additional white color choice added, with textures courtesy of SpiritWarden.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />-Forwarded SSE waterflow data\n<br />\n<br />-Poison spells from undeath rebalanced completely. \n<br />\n<br />-All spells added by undeath have been removed from leveled lists.

If you want to install this on an old save, clean your save with FallrimTools afterwards. Versions above 3.0 are entirely save-compatible with one another. [b]Do not i[/b]nstall this on savegames where you have used Immersive Lichdom or Undeath-The Ascension.\n<br />\n<br />If you have \"The Cause\" Creation, download the optional patch to unlock an ayleid lich form. Do not delete or rename the dummy esp file because the plugin name is used as a check in the mod scripts - its esl tagged so it doesnt take up a plugin slot anyways.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />The Undeath Cleaner xedit script attached in optional downloads is a soft requirement. While is not required for this mod to function as intended, it is still highly recommended that you clean the base Undeath.esp with the script as Undeath's wild edits can create compatibility issues with other mods.\xa0\n<br />To run the script, install the undeath cleaner script to your SSEEdit directory, placing the script in the 'Edit Scripts' folder. Load undeath.esp in SSEEdit, then click apply script on the Undeath.esp and select Hishy UndeathCleaner. Save the undeath esp after you run the script.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />As the files are packed in a bsa, make sure you do not have any incompatible undeath plugin such as Immersive Lichdom or Ascension.\xa0\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=2][b]Undeath and this mod should be loaded as high up in your load order as possible.

Otherwise, this mod is compatible with everything else (that is compatible with undeath).\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Death alternative mods are fully compatible before the lich ritual. After the ritual you will have to disable those death alternative effects because they overlap with lich resurrection. Compatibility with[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65136] Shadow of Skyrim[/url] is being worked on at the moment.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Undeath has a natural conflict with XMPSSE, if XPMSSE overwrites undeath, your lich will be invisible and/or the camera will be set to the floor. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50694]Install this mod if you are using XPMSSE.[/url]\xa0\xfeffStrange Runes requires a skeleton patch, use the same patch linked previously, it works regardless of whether you have xpmsse or strange runes.\n<br />\n<br />All perk and spell mods are fully compatible if the base Undeath.esp has been cleaned with the script. If you do not know how to use the script, make sure you load Undeath as high up in your load order as possible, i.e. right after USSEP.\xa0\n<br />All perk and spell mods should be loaded after Undeath.esp.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20046]Undeath Remastered - Facegen Data Patch[/url]\xa0is redundant with the latest version of Classical Lichdom, since I have also packed in undeath facegen files.

Monster Race Crash Fix is irrelevant for Undeath.\n<br />Tainted Blood is NOT compatible, the patch on the tainted blood page does not work and will break my mod.\n<br />\n<br />Undeath No Auto Quest Start is not compatible, you will end up receiving two quests. This mod has an integrated immersive start option.\n<br />\n<br />Old versions of Improved Camera (Beta 3) will crash your game if you transform in first person. But the latest version of Improved Camera is compatible!\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20733]Falkreath Hauntings[/url]\xfeff has severe navmesh conflicts with undeath and certain encounters from that mod will not work properly with undeath.\n<br />\n<br />This mod also edits the minor quests Lost Knowledge and the radiant black book quest to prevent them from sending the player to Undeath's Apocrypha dungeon. Mods that edit those quest forms will require a simple compatibility patch.\n<br />\n<br />If you want to integrate lich specific compatibility in your own mod, you can use the injected keyword \"ActorTypeLich' with ID\xa0\x30\x31\x30\x30\x35\x39\x31\x32.[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b][font=Comic Sans MS][color=#d5a6bd][size=5]Recommended Mods[/size][/color][/font][/b][font=Arial][color=#f4f4f4][size=2]\n<br />[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[font=Arial][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50694?tab=posts]Undeath XMPSSE Strange Runes Patch[/url] - Universal skeleton.nif patch.

(I believe there are no equippable vanilla spells with this delivery type)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ead1dc][b]I am stuck in lich form and I cannot move.[/b][/color]\n<br />-This happens when you try to equip a weapon in lich form, which entirely breaks the dragon priest skeleton. Transforming out of lich form will fix the issue. Pressing your death grip button (C by default) will automatically reequip the \"Revert Form\" power and allow you to transform out of lich form.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ead1dc]Lich form random crashes.[/color][/b]\n<br />-Not all lich form crashes are due to lich form, but lich form might become unstable due to mod conflicts. Generally, lich form in the SSE build of Undeath should not crash at all, but if it is crashing in a heavy load order, it might be a possible mod conflict. The game might crash if it tries to execute code that doesnt expect you to have a dragon priest skeleton. Make sure you have .Net Framework so that crashes can be diagnosed. \n<br />\n<br />There have been some reports of Engarde creating issues/crashes with beast transformations, including lichform.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ead1dc]My character is silent when swinging weapons.[/color][/b]\n<br />-Caused by a vanilla bug. After the player character enters bleedout, they might lose their voice. PC Headtracking and Voice Types has a fix for this bug. Nothing can be done on my end, though the mod has a convenient excuse for the player being silent - you are an undead lich after all!\n<br />\xa0[/size][color=#ead1dc]\n<br />[/color][size=2][color=#ead1dc][b]How do I get to Dragontail Mountain if fast travel is disabled?[/b][/color]\n<br />-Reading the 'Barrows of the Mountain' book will enable you to fast travel to and from the Mountain.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ead1dc][b]I cant change spell/access the spell menu in lich form[/b][/color]\n<br />[color=#f4f4f4]-If this issue is persistent, its a result of having incompatible undeath addons. If this happens randomly, its a temporary bug that happens when the game fails to register an animation event when transforming. Revert and transform back.\xa0[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ead1dc][b]I cant access the favorites menu in lich form[/b][/color]\n<br />[color=#f4f4f4]-The keybind hook for lich form favorites menu is separate from the normal one and defaults to Q. Rebind the key in your MCM.\xa0[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ead1dc][b]Is this compatible with Tainted Blood?[/b][/color]\n<br />-No. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58983]Use this mod[/url]\xa0if you insist on being a vampire and a lich at the same time. Being a vampire and a lich at the same time is not recommended.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ead1dc]Can I do the werewolf/vampire questlines after I become a lich?[/color]\n<br />[/b]-Technically, yes, because ww/vamp is only removed each time you transform into a lich. Therefore, you can technically complete those questlines by not using the lich transformation while the questlines are in progress. However, from an immersion standpoint, doing the vampire and werewolf questlines as a lich makes absolutely zero sense, so I do not recommend doing the questlines unless you are a serious completionist. Alternatively, you may choose to finish the questlines before becoming a lich for a more sensible roleplay experience. The dawnguard side of the questline is not affected in any manner.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ead1dc]Is this compatible with Undeath Ascension?\n<br />[/color][/b]-No, but the features of ascension have been ported to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58983]this mod[/url].\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ead1dc]Is this compatible with Undeath Immersive Lichdom?[/color][/b]\n<br />-No.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ead1dc]How does this compare to Ascension/Immersive Lichdom?[/color][/b]\n<br />-Both of the older undeath forks are much buggier, less polished and do not address fundamental issues with undeath. You might encounter some serious bugs playing the other undeath forks.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ead1dc]Should I use Classical Lichdom if I am using Undeath but I do not intend on becoming a lich?\n<br />[/color][/b]-Yes. Classical Lichdom improves and fixes multiple bugs present in the Undeath questline, therefore it is recommended for a bugfree Undeath experience. Lich features only apply to liches (duh) and will not bloat or bug your game if you have not become a lich.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][font=Comic Sans MS][/spoiler][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#d5a6bd][font=Arial][size=4][b]Roadmap[/b][/size][/font][/color]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />This is an updating small checklist for myself to add in minor details and quality of life improvements.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Things to do for version 3.6\n<br />-refactor questline scripts to prevent necromancer kill count from failing.
