nexusDescription="This is my second attempt at High Hrothgar utilizing what I've learned along the way with my other mods, to hopefully create something far superior to my first attempt.\xa0 This mod includes textures for everything High Hrothgar related, including additions to the door models with new textures.\xa0 The sprint gate outside of High Hrothgar has also been improved and has it's own texture.\xa0 I've also modified all of the steps leading up to High Hrothgar with better models, similar to Mathy's 3D steps mod.\xa0 There is an included ESPFE to apply texture sets for the new individual textures that match the shrines leading up to High Hrothgar, along the lines of the mod Pilgrim's Delight.\xa0 Finally, there are optional banner textures and textures for LOD generation for people who use DynDOLOD."
