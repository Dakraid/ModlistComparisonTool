nexusDescription="New hand-crafted textures for the Scathecraw plant in 2K HD. Vanilla style. Nice 'n simple.\n<br />\n<br />This is just a little one-off I've been wanting to do for a while.\xa0 I've always really liked the vanilla Scathecraw design/colors, but it just lacked any detail.\xa0 I popped open Photoshop last night and scribbled this up from scratch.\n<br />\n<br />The diffuse texture is BC3 (color+alpha) and normal map is BC7.\xa0 For this to work in Skyrim LE one would need to re-save the normal map as DXT5.\xa0 Anybody has my permission to back-port this, just give me credit.\n<br />\n<br />Enjoy!"
