nexusDescription="[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565]Wyrmstooth[/url] adds several new spells. Some of them are exactly the same as spells added by\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839]Mysticism[/url]. This small patch replaces the spell tomes of the duplicate spells in Wyrmstooth by their Mysticism counterparts. This way the player will have no way to access the duplicate spells, even though the spells (and their spell tomes) will still technically exist in the game.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Replaced spells (minor Wyrmstooth spoilers):[/b]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Conjure Skeleton - Replaced by Conjure Skeleton\n<br />[*]Night-Eye - Replaced by\xa0Nighteye\n<br />[*]Cure Disease - Replaced by Cure\n<br />[*]Ease Burden - Replaced by Feather (which has [i]exactly[/i]\xa0the same effect)\n<br />[/list][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Not replaced spells (minor Wyrmstooth spoilers):[/b]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Other conjure spells - There's already plenty of similar conjuration spells in Mysticism, but they're not exactly the same, so I kept them in, for the sake of some variety\n<br />[*]Ice Volley - I don't know [i]exactly[/i]\xa0what this spell does and if there is some spell in Mysticism that does exactly the same. So I kept it in, to be sure.\n<br />[*]Call of the Wild / Dead - there might be other spells with similar effects, but I don't think they're the same.\n<br />[/list][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />The patch is just a minor xEdit plugin. I made it for people who don't know how to do this themselves (or don't want to bother)."
