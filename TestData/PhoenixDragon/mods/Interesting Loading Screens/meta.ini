nexusDescription="[size=4]WHAT DOES THIS DO[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]This replaces all base game loading screen tips with more interesting ones.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]WHY THE CHANGE[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]I have never liked the vanilla loading screens because they usually said something extremely bland or obvious. Along the lines of \"[i]Any poison applied to an equipped weapon will be used on the next hit\". [/i]It seemed like a waste of an opportunity to tell something interesting.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]SPECIFICS[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Did you know you can make water boil by casting flames onto it?[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Did you know you can mine ore veins faster by dual wielding pickaxes?[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=2]\n<br />[i]You can learn these things any many more with this mod![/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]THE FINE PRINT[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]The plugin is saved as an ESL flagged ESP, so it won't take up a precious plugin slot.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]The only files it touches are the Loading screen text entries. Nothing else is changed in any way.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]I have only changed the base game files and as such this does not require any DLC (and does not change any DLC loading screens).[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]The entries are not\xa0necessarily matching with the picture art.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Install and uninstall this mod at any time. There are no scripts and it really shouldn't do anything naughty to your game.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]COMPATIBILITY[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]This should work with anything. It won't work with other mods that change the base game loading screen text.\n<br />\n<br />Some mods add their own loading screen entries (possibly by script). They will still appear even if this mod is loaded last.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]TO DO LATER[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Possibly match the loading screen entries to their provided pictures.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Add DLC content (and requirements).[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Add the option for vanilla replacement or standalone addon.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Add the option for immersion-breaking or non-immersion-breaking tips.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Fix any wrong grammar or spelling.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]THANKS AND PRAISE[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Thanks Kinggath for amazing mods\n<br />Thanks EnaiSiaion for amazing mods\n<br />Praise be to Talos[/size]"
