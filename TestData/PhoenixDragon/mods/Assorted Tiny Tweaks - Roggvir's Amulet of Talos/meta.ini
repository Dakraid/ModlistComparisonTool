nexusDescription="This page is a collection of several small mods that I might not otherwise release for a long time.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][size=4]Falion Is Rude[/size][/color]\n<br />Prevents Falion from greeting you when entering his home during business hours if you've never spoken to him before, so his introductory dialogue doesn't feel so out of place.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][size=4]I Know How Marriage Works[/size][/color]\n<br />When you first speak to Maramal about marriage, you have an option to tell him that you already know how it works instead of the vanilla \"no\" and \"maybe\" options.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][size=4]Roggvir's Amulet of Talos[/size][/color] [color=#999999](requires new game)[/color]\n<br />Gives a unique name to Roggvir's Amulet of Talos so that it doesn't stack with every other Amulet of Talos in your inventory and treat the whole stack as a quest item."
