nexusDescription=Draw knife done in substance painter and photoshop with altered UV and an added cubemap. The tree and bark i've had for a while so they are optional downloads. I have mathy's 3D trees installed including his Ancestor Glade tree so i don't actually use the tree retexture from this mod. See screenshots.
