nexusDescription="Utilizing Dynamic Animation Replacer (DAR), this mod intends to correct a massive oversight from Bethesda. Weapon drawing (when you equip or unequip your weapon) are dependent on your right hand weapon, regardless of your offhand weapon.\xa0Vanilla Skyrim is weird in that it supported dual wielding weapons, but only showed 1 weapon equipped when sheathed. When drawing two weapons it looked like you were drawing one. If you just download and use a dual drawing animation it'd always look like you were drawing two even if you weren't. My mod makes the animation apply when wielding two only so it actually looks right.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is intended to use with another mod that will show offhand weapons that are equipped such as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28833]All Geared Up Derivative (ALLGUD)[/url] by\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/21205994]cskriffin[/url] OR [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50049]Simple Dual Sheath[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/5217635]slavicpotato1[/url]. The mod now includes an ESP with an MCM menu (be gentle, this is my first) that allows you to independently choose whether the player stores shield on back when drawing their weapon.\n<br />\n<br />This mod now includes animations by default. You can always swap them out for others to better fit your style.\n<br />\n<br />Currently, this mod does not cover every type of drawing animation. I'm still hoping to find an animator interested in doing dagger/mace/sword/war axe combinations so that every weapon drawn matches how it should look. If you know anyone, please have them DM me!\n<br />\n<br />This mod affects the player as well as NPCs.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Other mods that add drawing animations[/u][/b]\n<br />I highly recommend [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4254]Immersive Animations[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/3324848?tab=user+files]Bergzore[/url]\xfeff. This mod includes animations for swords on back and daggers on back hip. Please remember to endorse other mod authors for their work!\n<br />\n<br />Do you know of other authors who've created drawing animations? Let's make a list."
