nexusDescription="[size=5]Kai has received a visually enhanced...well, nearly everything.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Kaidan is now recognized by the game as a [b]Nord[/b], instead of original Redguard. This, along some other segments of this update, may require [b]starting a new game[/b].[/size]\n<br />[/list][spoiler]I've found some useful information about Akaviri and their origins; they actually\xa0[i]may[/i]\xa0\x62\x65 related to Nords in some form, while they have absolutely nothing to do with Redguards.[/spoiler]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]The weight is changed from original 65 to [b]80.[/b]\xa0The guy is a tanky two-hander, he deserves some buff.[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]He has high poly head, independent of High Poly Head mod so it's not a requirement.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]I tried to stay faithful to his original face, but (hopefully) made it [b]much\xa0[/b]more handsome.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3][b]I fixed his original hair [/b]by merging two different hairstyles. It is now a beautiful, layered mane.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]I provide\xa0[b]three different facial tattoo options,[/b]\xa0\x63ustom made by me. Also fourth, the original Boethiah Cultist tattoo, for those who want it.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]I adjusted his default eyes to be just a little bit more impactful.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]I beautified his body textures and adjusted them to fit [b]various body types[/b]. Take your pick.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]This mod contains standard plugin (ESP). It can't be converted to ESL because of original mod's FormIDs. [/size]You [i]can[/i]\xa0\x63onvert it by compacting FormIDs in xEdit, but updating might break your ongoing save. You've been warned.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=#d9d2e9][b]Old Version (optional files FOMOD):[/b]\n<br />[/color][list]\n<br />[*][color=#d9d2e9]Original weight - 65[/color]\n<br />[*][color=#d9d2e9]Original hairstyle, tweaked[/color]\n<br />[*][color=#d9d2e9]Original facial tattoo (Boethiah Cultist), and another option (Xarxes)[/color]\n<br />[*][color=#d9d2e9]Original race - Redguard, and consequently more angular shape of the face because of that race (refer to \"old version\" images)[/color]\n<br />[*][color=#d9d2e9]Compatibility with all provided body types (except REALORE skin)[/color]\n<br />[*][color=#d9d2e9]Updated for the latest Kaidan 2 Extended Edition[/color]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />I adjusted Kai's existing pants for SOS Full body in Outfit Studio by using\xa0[url=https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5450-sos-armor-and-clothes-refits/]SOS refits[/url]. This mod is not a requirement, but it's recommended for SOS Full users. Don't use with HIMBO because that mod already has its own refits.\n<br />[url=https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/18004-high-poly-males-sos-for-sse/]High Poly Males for SOS[/url] by MegaCrunch is recommended for nude SOS Full body (not for HIMBO).\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff]For SOS Full and HIMBO body, use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7902]Tempered Skins for Males SOS Full[/url], or alternatively my [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61261]Trimmed Vitruvia[/url] combo. This will ensure schlong compatibility and imperceptible seam in the pubic area.[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]There is also compatibility provided for\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67029]REALORE for MEN[/url] for either SOS Full or HIMBO option, choose the type you use in the FOMOD.

Please thank the author for the effort.[/size]\n<br />Also keep up with the changes and updates, there's useful info in the\xa0[url=https://www.loverslab.com/topic/180533-sos-ae/]forum section[/url]\xa0\x66or any issues that might occur with SOS AE.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cfe2f3][size=3]I have also added [b]English Subtitle Corrections[/b]: ESL-flagged plugin that provides fixes for grammar errors in Kaidan's subtitles and resolves inconsistencies between subtitles and spoken lines.\n<br />This mod is meant to be used alongside [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63348]Kaidan 2 Extended Edition[/url] mod - [u]and make sure it's always the latest version[/u]. [b]It is entirely optional[/b], you don't have to use with High Poly Kaidan, or at all.

I don't use it and I never will because I don't see the point of it. If you do use it, you can try one of the non-nude Vanilla body options, although I don't know whether they're compatible.\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[size=3][b]INSTRUCTIONS FOR OLD FILES SECTION (outdated): [/b]ALL ADDONS CONTAIN ALTERED MAIN PLUGIN, SO IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE PLUGIN FROM THE ADDON OVERWRITES THE MAIN ONE. The FOMOD in Optional Files does the work for you, however (and it's updated).[/size][/size]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[b]These are the problems Kaidan's original visuals had:[/b]\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*]Kaidan's custom body texture isn't compatible with any texture for males, so you got different texture on hands and feet, and any adjustment of Kaidan's face resulted in a neck seam.\n<br />[*]If you \"undressed\" him with console or sex mods, his custom body texture with scars would disappear and it would be replaced with both body mesh and texture you're using for all males.\n<br />[*]If you're using any other body than vanilla, there would be a mismatch. For example, if you're using SOS Full, SOS underwear would clip through Kaidan's pants.\n<br />[*]At the beginning of the game in prison, he was supposed to wear prison rags to go with his bloody, tortured outlook, but he is wearing his standard pants instead.\xa0\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />Aside from various body options I provided, Kaidan now wears prisoner rags when you first meet him, and when you heal him - he \"miraculously\" switches to his regular pants. [/size](now his comments about \"bottled miracle\" and \"special gift\" make a lot more sense ;) )\n<br />[size=3]I wasn't able to make him keep the rags after healing to avoid this weird switch in clothing, because the whole thing is scripted - and I know next to nothing about scripting. There is an existing mesh for his \"healed rags\" in the base mod, as well as the bloody rags that you can now see, but for some reason neither are used. My guess is that they conflict with the script for his regular pants.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ffff00][size=4]Note:[/size][/color][/b][size=3] If you want Kai completely naked at some point, you can undress him by using the console: open console, type [b]unequipall[/b], click on Kaidan (or any other NPC for that matter), hit Enter, exit console. He'll be naked, but all of his stuff will remain in the inventory.\n<br />Conversely, you can use a practical mod such as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62934]PROTEUS[/url].\n<br />You'll be able to see Kaidan's scarred body in its full glory when using sex mods (Flower Girls, Osex). Regular undressing will show his pants, although sometimes he may end up totally naked when you just remove his armor. Telling him to \"put some clothes back on\" will equip his pants [/size](and you'll get an adorable line from him, thanks to Kaidan 2 Extended Edition mod)[size=3].\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#d9ead3][b]YOU ARE WELCOME and ENCOURAGED TO MAKE SCREENSHOTS BECAUSE I SUCK AT SCREENSHOTS[/b], as you may have already noticed in the featured images section. I'm kinda incompetent in that area. And my ENB preset may be weird to some (it is\xa0[b]very[/b]\xa0\x64\x65saturated and I avoid DOF like the plague), which is why Kaidan may look [b]paler than he really is[/b]\xa0in my screenshots.[/color]\n<br />[/size][i][b][color=#f4cccc][size=3]&gt;&gt;&gt;Big thank you to\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/319078]Lyre2r14[/url] for sending lovely screenies of previous versions of the mod![/size][/color][/b][/i]\n<br />[size=4]\n<br />Let me know if something looks wonky and I'll do my best to fix it.
