nexusDescription="[size=3]Fixes a severe memory leak issue in RaceMenu 0.4.16\xa0(SE 1.5.97) skee64 binary due to armor and inventory object 3D never getting released. The issue is present in RaceMenu versions from\xa0\x30.4.10 to\xa0\x30.4.19.9.1, possibly older ones too.\n<br />\n<br />[b]This does not contain code or any other assets from\xa0\x65xpired6978's RaceMenu and will [u]not[/u] do anything by itself. [/b]It\xa0works by injecting additional code which handles cleanup into skee64.dll at runtime so it needs to be installed and loaded to work.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Only works on SE (runtime 1.5.97) and RM 0.4.16\xa0[/b]using pattern matching to validate the skee64 binary.\xa0[b]It won't do anything for any other version[/b]. Make sure to update if you're still using a RM version older than 0.4.16, those have [url=https://github.com/expired6978/SKSE64Plugins/issues/42]atleast one other severe bug[/url] that doesn't always sort extra data on meshes properly (frequently happens when using the memory manager from EngineFixes), causing body morphs and transforms to randomly fail along with other potential issues.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]If you're running on the current game version (AE 1.6.353), grab the latest (public) release from [url=https://www.patreon.com/posts/racemenu-0-4-19-66659308]expired's patreon (0.4.19.9.2)[/url], it contains this fix. As of the time of writing this, that release has not been uploaded to the nexus page.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]It's unlikely that the author will provide a SE build with this fixed (please don't harass them about it). Due to the severity of the issue, the popularity of RaceMenu and the fact that many users are still on SE, this hotfix may be of some general use.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Installation:[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Requires\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080/]RaceMenu 0.4.16[/url]\xa0\x66or game version 1.5.97 and all of it's requirements, it can be found in the old files section.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Install this normally with a mod manager or manually copy into &lt;skyrim root&gt;&#92;Data[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />No configuration required.\n<br />\n<br />If installed, it generates a log at '&lt;documents&gt;&#92;My Games&#92;Skyrim Special Edition&#92;SKSE&#92;skee64-memleak-patch.log' each time you run the game informing you if patching was successful.\n<br />\n<br />Source available [url=https://github.com/SlavicPotato/skee64-memleak-patch]here[/url][/size]"
