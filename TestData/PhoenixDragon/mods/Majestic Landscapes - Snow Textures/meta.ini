nexusDescription="[font=Georgia][size=5]What the mod does:\n<br />[/size][/font]\n<br />This mod seperates my old Complementary Pack from Majestic Mountains.\n<br />I redesigned almost the whole texture pack.\n<br />\n<br />This pack is very good for landscape grass transition, has minimal tiling and certain compression artifacts are decreased to a minimal level.\n<br />While I used advanced downsizing techniques to get the maximum detail in 2k textures.\n<br />\n<br />4K textures simply didn't improve the quality anymore.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][size=5]Compatibility:[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />I tested the transitions with the grass from\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21954?tab=description]Cathedral Landscapes\n<br />[/url] (please read the installation section) and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26293]Veydosebrom[/url].\n<br />And the transitions with the lod worked pretty good.\n<br />\n<br />The mod is compatible with all worldmap mods.\n<br />\n<br />The mod is incompatible with all landscape texture mods. Except texture packs that cover Solstheim only.\n<br />\n<br />The transition with grass mods is usally pretty good. I was very careful in selecting the texture that I've put in this pack.\n<br />But I highly recommend [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42161?tab=description]this mod[/url] to achieve an absolutely seamless transition. \n<br />\n<br />My personal recommondation for the mod is:\n<br />\n<br />[i][i]ExtendGrassDistance = True[/i]\n<br />OverwriteGrassDistance = 12000\n<br />[i]OverwriteGrassFadeRange = 8000\n<br />[/i][/i]\n<br />For a really good performance/ quality ratio. Because this will render grass on the lod meshes. \n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][size=5]Installation:[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />Simply install to mod and overwrite conflicts as long as you don't plan to keep certain textures from another mod."
