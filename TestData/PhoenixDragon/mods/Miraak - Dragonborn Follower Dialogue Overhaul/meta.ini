nexusDescription="This is my first mod release after years of enjoying the mods the community had to offer. This mod edit was created by me about a year ago but I was a little unsure about making it public. However considering there are a lot of people that might want more dialogue like me I decided to do this as a thank you to transientfaith and this wonderful community.\n<br />\n<br />Also if you have the time, please give an endorsement to transientfaith's original mod: \xfeff[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43529]www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43529[/url]\n<br />\n<br />This is an expansion of a certain follower I loved adventuring with, Miraak the First Dragonborn. Only problem was how limited his dialogue in the original mod was and after playing Relationship Dialogue Overhaul I wanted to expand on this in the same manner For those that enjoyed this \"what if\" scenerio travelling with Miraak, you'll be happy to know I've improved his old dialogue\xa0 and created new ones in various areas.\n<br />\n<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />[size=3][size=4]Link to the LE version: \xfeff[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/104831/]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/104831/[/url][/size][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][font=Georgia][i][size=4][b]Features: [/b][/size]\n<br />[/i][size=4]\n<br />[size=3]-General follower and combat dialogues replaced and expanded upon.\n<br />\n<br />-Comments on different world locations including Dragon Lairs, Sky Haven Temple and Throat of the World.\n<br />\n<br />-Comments on views, black book readings, caves and dragon kills.\n<br />\n<br />-Marriage dialogue and scenes have been improved.\n<br />\n<br />-Extra dialogue to ask \"Anything on your mind?\" and for him to recite his mantra.[/size][/size]\n<br />[/font]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][b][size=3][size=4]*Be sure to replace the original mod with this mod file. I tried not to...but ended up having to edit the original MiraakFollower.esp in order to get the added dialogue to work and replace his old lines.[/size] \n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b][size=3]^[/size][size=3]No gameplay changes have been made to his old esp (MiraakFollower.esp), I only removed some of the dialogue. [/size][b]\n<br />[/b][i]\n<br />[font=Arial][size=2]\n<br />[/size][/font][/i][size=2][font=Verdana][size=3][font=Arial][i]I realize there is another mod like this that was released a year ago (another reason why I was unsure of releasing this before) but this one expands on more areas of interaction which add to the experience of having Miraak as a companion. Obviously you are free to choose whichever mod you like.[/i][/font]\n<br />[/size][/font]\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />I hope you all enjoy this one. Sorry but I probably won't be doing any updates after this release.\n<br />\n<br />Have fun![/size]\n<br />\n<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />Special Thanks:\n<br />Bethseda for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Special Edition\n<br />transientFaith for the original (and awesome) mod Miraak - Dragonborn Follower \n<br />cloudedtruth for Relationship Dialogue Overhaul, the inspiration that made this happen."
