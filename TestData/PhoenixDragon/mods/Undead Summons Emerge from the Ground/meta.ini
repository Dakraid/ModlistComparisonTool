nexusDescription="[center][size=4][b]Description:\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size]A simple animation replacer to make all undead emerge from the ground when summoned.\n<br />(provided they use the special_summon.hkx animation file inside the \x201c\x64raugr\x201d folder which I think are most skeleton/draugr etc. summons)\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]bC_GJX3j38k[/youtube]\n<br />Video by Jebbalon (thank you)\n<br />\n<br />Summoned undead creatures dont always play the \"special_summon.hkx\" animation when summoned so sometimes they might still just appear normally although very rarely.[/center][center]Most of the time\xfeff they should emerge from the ground as seen in the pictures and video.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />OPTIONAL FILE:\n<br />\n<br />Simply replaces the summon bubble with another effect.\n<br />Many of you requested this but as I said before, you probably will see the skeletons body fall into the ground before it emerges again.[/center][center][font=Times New Roman]\xfeffThis happened with the bubble aswell but you rarely saw it because the bubble was kinda hiding it.\n<br />THIS WILL REPLACE THE BUBBLE FOR ALL SUMMONS!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/font]LE Version (by Corvinus18):\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/101939]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/101939[/url][/center]"
