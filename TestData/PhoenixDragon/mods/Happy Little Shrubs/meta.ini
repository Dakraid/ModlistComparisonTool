nexusDescription="This mod is made with assets from\xa0T4GTR34UM3R's\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50961]Happy Little Trees[/url], my idea is to make some tree saplings that matches the trees from Happy Little Trees. The mod\xa0replaces all vanilla pineshrubs and fallforestshrubs, including ash and snow variants.\xa0\n<br />This mod is mesh only and requires textures from Happy Little Trees to work.\n<br /> The \xfeffplugin is to make all related plants vertical so they won't be pointing to all directions, there's also a txt file that makes TexGen generate billboard textures for these plants when you run DynDOLOD.\n<br />Now supports [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861]Seasons of Skyrim[/url], but not tested yet.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility:\n<br />[/b]Compatible with any other mods. If you're using Seasons of Skyrim make sure my file is placed lower than other season related mods.\n<br />If you wish to use the shrubs from this mod with other tree mods (not recommended since they are made especially for Happy Little Trees), you can overwrite Happy Little Trees with other mods and let my mod overwrite all.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Credits:[/b]\n<br />T4GTR34UM3R for\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50961]Happy Little Trees\n<br />[/url]toostruus for fixing the plugin"
