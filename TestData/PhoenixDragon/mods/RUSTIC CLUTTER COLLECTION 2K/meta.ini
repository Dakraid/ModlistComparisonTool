nexusDescription="[size=3][font=Verdana][b]RUSTIC CLUTTER COLLECTION[/b] is exactly what is sounds like, a collection of my recent RUSTIC series of retextures for clutter items in Skyrim. I didn&#39;t really have a plan to do all these items originally, but they just drew my attention as things that could use a facelift. Once I had completed a few of these Rustic retexture mods, I began getting requests to combine them for easier load management. They had grown to the\xa0\x65xtent that I felt it was time to fulfill that wish. I now brings these retextures to Skyrim Special Edition.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: If you are using SMIM, the textures for the SMIM tankards are included with this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://s150.photobucket.com/user/Blue-Bolt/media/Skyrim/Rustic-Clutter_title.jpg.html][img]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s86/Blue-Bolt/Skyrim/Rustic-Clutter_title.jpg~original[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />This is a collection of my Rustic clutter item retextures. This mod includes the RUSTIC DINNERWARE, RUSTIC POTTERY, and RUSTIC SILVERWARE mods. There are also a few more clutter items included like mead bottles, wine bottles, the\xa0satchel, knapsack,\xa0\x63oin purse, strongbox, safe, prisoner cage, and the dwemer lexicon cubes. 2K and 1K versions available.\r<br />\r<br />[/font][/size][size=3][font=Verdana][center][youtube]Fi_Frt6z-TQ[/youtube][/center]\r<br />[url=http://s150.photobucket.com/user/Blue-Bolt/media/Skyrim/Rustic-Mead_Slides_front.jpg.html][img]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s86/Blue-Bolt/Skyrim/Rustic-Mead_Slides_front.jpg~original[/img][/url][/font][font=Verdana]\r<br />\r<br />As\xa0\x61lways, pick the resolution that works for your system... 2K or 1K. I hope this makes for an easier\xa0installation for people who already use these mods. They all have a similar esthetic, so they compliment each other in game.\r<br />\r<br />Cheers,\r<br />Gamwich\r<br />[/font]\r<br />[url=http://s150.photobucket.com/user/Blue-Bolt/media/Skyrim/Rustic-Dinnerware_title.jpg.html][img]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s86/Blue-Bolt/Skyrim/Rustic-Dinnerware_title.jpg~original[/img]\r<br />[/url]\r<br />[url=http://s150.photobucket.com/user/Blue-Bolt/media/Skyrim/Rustic-Pottery_Slides_Front.jpg.html][img]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s86/Blue-Bolt/Skyrim/Rustic-Pottery_Slides_Front.jpg~original[/img]\r<br />[/url]\r<br />[url=http://s150.photobucket.com/user/Blue-Bolt/media/Skyrim/Rustic-Silverware_Slides_Title_small.jpg.html][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/60963-0-1468179904.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[/url][url=http://s150.photobucket.com/user/Blue-Bolt/media/Skyrim/Exclusive_to_Nexus.jpg.html][img]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s86/Blue-Bolt/Skyrim/Exclusive_to_Nexus.jpg~original[/img][/url]\r<br />[/size]"
