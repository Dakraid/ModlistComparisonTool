Trust me it's trash.\xa0\n<br />Here we use the ruined book mesh as it's much nicer and allows for custom paper textures, which I just discovered\xa0\n<br />to my delight! Don't stress though, this won't overwrite the ruined book. I'm smart like that.\n<br />Same story really. Threw the mush in the bin. Crafted some details from scratch and resolved them in 4k. Hope you like :)\n<br />\n<br />[b]The versions available are as follows:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />- 4k Burned Book\n<br />- 2k Burned Book\n<br />- 1k Burned Potato\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#000000][size=6]I[/size][/color]nstallation:[/b]\n<br />Not actually sure why this is a section......

The textures!\n<br />To put it plainly they suck. I tried to ignore it but over time it got to me so much that I literally forced myself to learn the art of creating textures just so I could fully immersive myself in glorious and copious amounts of detail.\n<br />Eventually I realised maybe other people would enjoy my creations. And so here I am sharing my many hours of trials and errors with this amazing community and if even one other person can enjoy them as I have I count that as a success!\n<br />\n<br />[i]Thank you to this amazing community of mod creators and users I am humbled to be counted as one of you. :)[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[b][color=#000000][size=6]W[/size][/color]hy I'm on Patreon:[/b]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />As some of you may know or have guessed, modding takes many hours, many more cups of tea and yet more cups of coffee. I do it because I love it and because I get excited when I share my creations and others love it too.\n<br />That being said, if you enjoy my work and would like to support what I do by shouting me a coffee or a tea, that would make me extremely happy indeed.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][i][b]Disclaimer: I will of course continue to create mods whether I receive support through patreon or not.[/b][/i][/color][size=4][b][color=#000000][size=6]\n<br />\n<br />F[/size][/color][size=2]AQ[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]What mods are you using in your screenshots (generally)?\n<br />-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6372]Tamriel Reloaded[/url]\xfeff\n<br />-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2296]Verdant - A Skyrim Grass Plugin[/url]\xfeff\n<br />-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48526]SkyRealism - Shiny[/url]\xfeff (the elven armour)\n<br />-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15501]Stockade Wood Revamped[/url]\xfeff\n<br />-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20792]aMidianBorn Steel Armor[/url]\n<br />-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1839]Y.A.L.O - Yet Another Landscape Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3271]CFL ENB -\xa0 Cinematic Film Looks[/url]\xfeff\n<br />-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1383]Extra Smooth Agence de Modele High Poly Mesh Mod with Mountains including Eyecandy Staff of Magnus Refracting Potions Parallax Soulgems and\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\x46toppka Smelter[/url]\xfeff\xa0(my favourite mod name lol)\xa0\n<br />-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2187]Vivid Weathers Definitive Edition[/url]\xfeff\n<br />-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12371]Skyrim 3d Trees\n<br />\n<br />[/url][b]Why are the colours so bright and saturated?[/b]\n<br />It's my personal enb settings.
