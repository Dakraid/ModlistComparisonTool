nexusDescription="Skyrim has quite a few object meshes that have their shaders or blending properties set incorrectly. As a result, when using ENBSeries many of these objects look buggy or react to incorrect parameters, making it impossible to correctly set up your ENB preset for consistent visuals. The main goal of this patch is to address at least the more obvious inconsistencies so that the affected objects react to a correct parameters and are as bright or dim as you set.\n<br />\n<br />Some of the more notable fixes and improvements included:\n<br />\n<br />* Various ambient smoke effects now correctly react to [PARTICLE] settings.\n<br />* Most water related effects now respond correctly to [PARTICLE] settings.\n<br />* Windhelm, Riften and Jorvaskr windows now react to [WINDOWLIGHT] settings.\n<br />* Most steam effects now respond to [PARTICLE] settings.\n<br />* Various fog effects now respond to [PARTICLE] settings.\n<br />* Light shafts now respond to [PARTICLE] settings.\n<br />* Floating particles (leaves, needles, seeds) now respond to [PARTICLE] settings.\n<br />* Dragon flame and related effects now respond to [FIRE] settings.\n<br />* Flame Atronach now responds to [WINDOWLIGHT] and [FIRE] settings.\n<br />* Spider webs are no longer too bright and respond to [PARTICLE] settings.\n<br />* Blowing snow now responds to [PARTICLE] settings.\n<br />* Brazier, torch fires now support complex fire lights.\n<br />* Scars and eyebrows now use subsurface scattering.\n<br />* Candles now support subsurface scattering.\n<br />\n<br />The installer provides a choice between BSA or Loose files installation of core components.\n<br />\n<br />In addition, the patch also contains an assortment of other goodies such as:\n<br />\n<br />* Fixes and improvements to various objects.\n<br />* Fixes and improvements to some spell effects.\n<br />* Increases number of particles of certain effects.\n<br />* Makes it possible to enable ENBSeries during loading screens and improves the fog effect.\n<br />* Adds particle light to some objects such as Chaurus eggs, magic mushrooms and floating motes, Soltsheim lanterns.\n<br />* Optional higher res effect textures, adding more detail and eliminating banding artifacts seen in many effects.\n<br />\n<br />The custom textures will use slightly more video memory (VRAM) but other than that, there should be no performance toll.\n<br />\n<br />Compatible with both SE and AE.\n<br />\n<br />Make sure to also use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23174]ENB Helper SE[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Note that in regards to particles, while you can control their properties with the settings under [PARTICLE] category some effects respond to the plain Intensity parameters, but depending on the type some others react to LightingInfluence and AmbientInfluence parameters. These two types are mutually exclusive. In the case of latter, you will be basically controlling the extent the particle color is inherited from ambient and direct (sun) light color.\n<br />\n<br />Since many mods use these meshes as a base and/or further improve them for their own purposes the conflict resolving rule of thumb is simple:\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][b][center]\xfeffIn case of conflicts, let every mod overwrite.[/center][/b][/color]\n<br />If you do spot something out of place, especially particle related (possibly not covered by this patch), please let me know and I will see what I can do."
