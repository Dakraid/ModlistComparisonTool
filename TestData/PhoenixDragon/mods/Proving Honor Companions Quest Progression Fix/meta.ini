nexusDescription="In the vanilla game, after retrieving the Fragment of Wuuthrad in \"Proving Honor\", Vilkas will only be waiting for you at Jorrvaskr if you passed through the space directly inside the main gate entrance to Whiterun or at the top of the stairs to Dragonreach. If you fast-travel to another marker in the city, leave Dragonsreach by going over the wall, or enter the city through another route, he will be going about his usual routine and the quest marker will point you to Skjor. Talking to Skjor will complete \"Proving Honor\", but not start the next quest, and while your journal will direct you to ask the Companions leaders for work, they will have no tasks for you.\n<br />\n<br />This mod ensures that entering Whiterun [i]at all[/i] will set up for the end of \"Proving Honor\" in the same way that entering through the main gate does. Vilkas will be waiting in front of Jorrvaskr to lead you to your initiation ceremony.\n<br />\n<br />ESL-flagged, no quest edits. Open Cities-compatible version available as optional file."
