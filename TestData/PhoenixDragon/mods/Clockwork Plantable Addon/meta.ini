nexusDescription="[center]I've wanted some Hearthfire soil patches to customize Clockwork's Glass Garden for years, and even more since I've been using CACO.\n<br />Kept hoping someone would release an addon, or that some would get added to base Clockwork. Neither happened, so I decided to do it myself.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Adds 14 Hearthfire soil patches to the Glass Garden, distributed throughout the planters. All patches are within reach and visible from the side of the planters, so there's no need to go climbing through the garden to find them. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />ESL-flagged ESP, requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4155]Clockwork (SSE)[/url]\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Addon is provided as-is; feel free to report any issues and I may get to them, but I provide no guarantee of further support.[/center]"
