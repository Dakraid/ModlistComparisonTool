nexusDescription="[center][size=6]The Great Village of Old Hroldan\xfeff\n<br />[/size]And Soljund's Sinkhole\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]irG4NrWfw5o[/youtube]\n<br />Thanks to Arctic Scrolls for showcasing my mod!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/yx15mxQ.jpg[/img]\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Old Hroldan\n<br />[/b][/size]Old Hroldan is a small settlement in the Reach. Hundreds of years ago the Reach was torn apart by a war not unlike the current one. It is the site of an ancient battleground where Tiber Septim defeated an army of Reachmen by shouting down it's walls. As such Old Hroldan is the stone upon which the Empire was built. Though Old Hroldan might not be a big settlement it was this battle that earned it a place in the annals of history.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/aPVCTbr.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The Great Village of Old Hroldan overhauls the settlement with a new Reach building set. The inn has it's own unique exterior and two farmhouses are added. It also replaces the nearby Soljund's Sinkhole farmhouse with a new one.\xfeff The style of the buildings is inspired by Breton architecture.\xa0Interiors use the Solitude tileset. The meshes are new but the textures are from Solitude. Because of this every texture overhaul that affects Solitude affects this mod. I used Noble Skyrim in the screenshots. Though worship of Talos may be outlawed he is still a respected man in the empire. The town now has a statue to remember his victory.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Compatibility[/size]\n<br />[/b]This mod is not compatible with any mod that significantly alters the area around Old Hroldan, Soljund's Sinkhole or their interiors.\n<br />\n<br />For now the mod is not compatible with ELFX. It won't break your game but it will cause lighting and effects issues in the inn.\n<br />\n<br />My other city mods:\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/10182460?tab=user+files]Find my other mods here![/url]\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />I don't have a lot to offer but if you like my work and are interested in supporting me I have a Patreon :)\n<br />[size=6][url=https://www.patreon.com/Archinatic][color=#ff7700]Patreon[/color][/url][/size]\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]A big thanks to the person who recently donated :)[/size][/center]"
