nexusDescription="Adds the relevant variable binding set to the 3 main unarmed power attack entries in the 1hm_behavior.hkx files so that unarmed power attacks will scale the animation speed with weaponspeedmult like other weapons.\n<br />\n<br />Comes with a nemesis patch in case you have another mod that also has 1hm_behavior files.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />UPDATE 1.1:\n<br />\n<br />Added another version that can have unlocked movement during unarmed power attacks if you use the console command player.sgv bHandToHandUnlocked 1\n<br />It works in 1st and 3rd person but you will ice skate fiercely in 3rd person. This archive contains the weapon speed scaling fix as before.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Also if you want a nice seamless unarmed mod to complement this mod, check out\xa0https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Notes:\n<br />\n<br />You must use a fist weapon and not the default unarmed weapon to get any benefit from weaponspeedmult on normal or power attacks. I don't know how to fix this but would be happy to if someone knows the secrets.\n<br />\n<br />Bugs (kind of):\n<br />\n<br />Just like with normal weapons, once weaponspeedmult gets high, you will do a normal attack before the power attack (there is an intermediate amount of weaponspeedmult where you start the normal attack but the power attack kicks in halfway through). It can kind of look janky but also looks kind of like a 2 hit combo.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[s]I haven't unlocked the power attacks, so you are still locked in place when power attacking or using the dual wield punch combo (which does scale with weaponspeedmult).[/s]\xa0NOW UNLOCKED AS OF 1.1 but CGO will look better in 3rd person so use that and the 1.0 file and use nemesis(probably won't work with the 1.1 file but no reason to use them together)."
