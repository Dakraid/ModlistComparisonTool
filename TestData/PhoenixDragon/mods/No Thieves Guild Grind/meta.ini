nexusDescription="I made this mod for myself and realized no one uploaded one yet for SSE, so I decided to share. \r<br />\r<br />Pretty simple - This mod lowers the requirements to get the rewards for the radiant quests of the Thieves Guild\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Before you needed to do: 5, 15,25,35,45,55,75,125 quests to get the full rewards as well as 5 in each Hold before the Hold specific quest. (I personally never made it above 35 without getting bored out of my mind and using console commands)\r<br />[*]Now you only have to do ONE quest in each Hold to get the corresponding quest and the levels for the items at the Guild Master&#39;s desk are: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. \r<br />[/list]\r<br />12 radiant quests are all you need to do to get it all done.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />PS- This should even work if you already have done some of the radiant quests - users have confirmed that.
