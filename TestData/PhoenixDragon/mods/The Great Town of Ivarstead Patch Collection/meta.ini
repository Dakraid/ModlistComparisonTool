nexusDescription="Continuing with my series of \"I want to run with unique architecture everywhere, but that requires SO MANY compatibility patches\" series....Ivarstead! soldierofwar put together a lovely little overhaul of Ivarstead in his [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34505]The Great Town of Ivarstead[/url]\xfeff, and I've put together a series of compatibility patches for things in my load order which needed it. All patches are ESP flagged as ESL, unless otherwise noted.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Included Patch Descriptions[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654]AI Overhaul SSE[/url] - shifts some placed idle markers to match the new interior/exteriors. Made for 1.5.3, should be good through 1.6.6.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104]Atlas Map Markers[/url] - NOTE: Based off MCM version. Shifts map marker for Vilemyr Innto match new layout, adds map markers for the added temple and store. MCM toggles supported. AMM patches are being released for other patch collections will require end-user CR between patches in order for MCM \n<br />toggling to work for everything. Last checked against version 2.0\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36506]Cheesemod for EVERYONE[/url] - Shifts a few added cheeses to match the new interior. Last checked against version 1.01\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924]Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul[/url] - reposition of new vegetables added by CACO into new interiors. Last checked against version 2.0.8\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6130]Distinct Interiors[/url] - Patch here was just disabling Distinct Interiors. Removed from FOMOD and put into Old Files section for posterity. Use Czasior's patch [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46021]here[/url] instead.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url] \xfeff- Only one patch this time around, due to there being a few new buildings and wanting to keep consistency in lighting mood across all of them. Forwards any conflicts having Great Town of Ivarstead win, shifted any added smoke to match the new interiors, and shifted door lights where appropriate. Last checked against version 3.06.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14368]Embers HD[/url] - Shifts the placement of the fire for Embers to match the new interior of the Vilemyr Inn. Last checked against version 1.3998. \n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085]Embers XD[/url] - Shifts the placement of fires to better utilize the new look of Embers XD, includes some ashes spread around, and in a few places substitutes \n<br />fire types to better match aesthetics. Last checked against version 2.4beta. Will not work with earlier versions.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/595]Immersive Wenches[/url] - moves a couple idle markers to match the new interiors. Last checked against version 1.60SE\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194]Interesting NPCs[/url] - Re-upload of ShadowOfNV's patch from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34535]here[/url] (make sure to click the link and endorse!) with the proper v1.1 fix because I had xEdit open when saving the patch and the uploaded version there is missing a bedroll fix. I had a link to it in the comments for a while now, but since it hasn't been updated, I'm putting it here for now. If requested, or if the original page updates, I'll remove this one from here, I just didn't want anyone to miss the latest update. Last checked against version 4.4\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289]JK's Skyrim[/url] - Update to existing JK's Skyrim patch, to alter the added building to match the Great Town of Ivarstead aesthetic. ESP and ESL version provided. I recommend using the ESL version unless on an existing save, in which case I [i]think[/i] you should be able to update using the ESP version (and existing bashed/smashed patches should definitely work on the ESP version if on a new save). Last checked against version 1.6.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19075]Kaidan 2[/url] - Hooks up navmesh properly for Kaidan 2's changes outside town. Patches for with/without JKs. LOTD users will probably want to open up the CK and finalize things themselves with this, as well, but we're getting to the point where we'd need 6 patches to cover every case and it'd scale from there. Last checked against version 2.1.1\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138]Landscape and Water Fixes[/url] - Conflict resolution for records touched by both mods, forwarding ownership changes. Last checked against version 5.3\n<br />\n<br />Landscape Grass Patch - No link for this one, specifically. The Great Town of Ivarstead repaints some of the landscape in such a way that some grass mods (I use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2296]Verdant [/url]in the screenshots) throw grass ALL OVER the place. This patch attempts to ape what [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9005]Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods[/url] does so elegantly by re-doing the painting of the landscape in such a way that the grass isn't overwhelming. From my testing, this is NOT needed if you're using the JK's Patch.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817]Lanterns of Skyrim II [/url]\xfeff- Two patches available - one with, and one without JKs. If you're using JKs, you will still need the Lanterns of Skyrim II - JKs patch. You should only be using ONE of these patches, however - all the base changes are included in the JKs one. Last checked against version 4.0.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802]Legacy of the Dragonborn [/url]\xfeff- Moves one placed gem and a drunk idle marker. No transport crates or fliers in the Vilemyr Inn. Go fig. Last checked against a v5 revision, but might work with v4 as well. Two versions - one for JK and one without, for the outdoor navmesh.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10908]Mirai - The Girl with the Dragon Heart[/url] - Shifts a sitting idle marker on the High Hrothgar bridge to match the new bridge layout. Last checked against version 2.11\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22622]More to Say[/url] - forwards persistence on a few references. Last checked against version 8.0.3\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5017]Populated Skyrim HELL Edition[/url] - shifts markers to match the new interiors/exteriors. Last checked against version 4.0. Thanks to Cecell for the patch\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2005]Populated Cities and Towns[/url] - shifts markers to match the new interiors/exteriors. Last checked against version 4.1.\n<br />\n<br />Redguard Elite Armaments - CC patch which shifts a lean marker to match the new exterior (and something to lean on).\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5261]Skyrim's Unique Treasures[/url] - Shifts the location of two placed objects to match the new interiors. Last checked against version 4.4\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2414]Snazzy Furniture and Clutter Overhaul[/url] - Shifts placed paintings to match new interiors. Last checked against version 1.7\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch[/url] - Conflict resolution patch which forwards an some cell data and some ownership data to match new exteriors. Last checked against version 4.2.3\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28228]World Assets Recycle Project[/url] - Moves objects to new exterior. Due to nature of changes (quest-locked), and sizable amount of changes, all references are moved south of town across the bridge towards Riften. Not fully tested, please treat as alpha/beta, but also please give feedback! Based on v1.01a.\n<br />\n<br />Additional patches are available for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35406]SMIM[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34652]JK's Skyrim[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34534]The Notice Board[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42423?]Immersive Laundry[/url], and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46021]Distinct Interiors[/url]. Give 'em a look and a like!\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Installation[/i][/size]\n<br />Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into you Skyrim data folder. \n<br />Patches should have their appropriate masters set, and should be loaded after any mods which they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects, and may require a new save.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Compatibility[/i][/size]\n<br />I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods. All moved objects should have been moved to locations which are non-overlapping. Let me know if you hit anything\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Credits[/i][/size]\n<br />[url=https://bethesda.net/]Bethesda[/url] for Skyrim Special Edition and the Creation Kit\n<br />ElminsterAU for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164]SSEEdit[/url]\n<br />soldierofwar for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34505]The Great Town of Ivarstead[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/403844]giovanni1214[/url] for the JK's Skyrim patch\n<br />mnikjom and SpiderAkiraC for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654]AI Overhaul[/url]\n<br />Kronixx and kryptopyr for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104]Atlas Map Markers[/url]\n<br />aviform, EpicCrab, DoubtSuspended, PhysicsFish, and Daniel Hodge for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36506]Cheesemod for EVERYONE[/url]\n<br />kryptoptyr for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924]Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />Sokkvabekk for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6130]Distinct Interiors[/url]\n<br />anamorfus for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url]\n<br />mindflux for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14368]Embers HD[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085]Embers XD[/url]\n<br />lordkoz for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/595]Immersive Wenches[/url]\n<br />Kris Takahashi for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194]Interesting NPCs[/url]\xfeff and ShadowOfNV for the first revision of the patch\n<br />jkrojmal and Teabag86 for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289]JK's Skyrim[/url]\n<br />livtempleton for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19075]Kaidan 2[/url]\n<br />wizkid34 for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138]Landscape and Water Fixes [/url]and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817]Lanterns of Skyrim II[/url] and Tamriel Master Lights\n<br />code1k for the excellent [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9005]Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods[/url] which this does not edit/have as master, but is very heavily inspired by\n<br />icecreamassassin, SirJesto, and the LOTD team for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802]Legacy of the Dragonborn[/url]\n<br />BigAndFlabby and kaleidx for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10908]Mirai - The Girl with the Dragon Heart\n<br />[/url]abramcf for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22622]More to Say[/url]\xfeff\n<br />the Sands of Time team for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2005]Populated Cities and Towns[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5017]Populated Skyrim HELL Edition[/url]\n<br />isoku for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2182]Realistic Water Two[/url]\n<br />clintmich and icecreamassassin for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/526]Skyrims Unique Treasures[/url]\n<br />gutmaw for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2414]Snazzy Furniture and Clutter Overhaul[/url]\n<br />Arthmoor and the Unofficial Patch Team for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Project[/url]\n<br />AndrealphusVIII, TheBxushis, and SkyLover264 for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28228]World Assets Recycle Project[/url]"
