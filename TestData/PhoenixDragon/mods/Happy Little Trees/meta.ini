nexusDescription="[size=4]Happy Little Trees is final.\n<br />It is renamed and polished. Finally!\n<br />\n<br />What the mod does:\n<br />\n<br />[color=#d8d8d8][size=3]Happy Little Trees is a Vanilla Tree Replacer that aims for good visuals while having a very low performance cost\n<br />There are great looking, performance expensive trees on many Discord Channels and fast trees on the Nexus.\n<br />But I missed a tree mod that tried to combine both worlds.\n<br />\n<br />I measured an impact of 5 FPS with a disabled FPS limit on my GTX 970. Which is pretty pleasant result.\n<br />\n<br />The next feature of this trees are the animations. Because the trees are skinned. No more repeating wobble of branches every 10 seconds.\n<br />The branches are moving very naturally.\n<br />\n<br />I present you several options for tree lod too.\n<br />[/size][/color][/size][list]\n<br />[*][color=#d8d8d8][size=3]you will find lods for the very basic vanilla style tree creation in the download section[/size][/color]\n<br />[*][color=#d8d8d8][size=3]you find a guide in the article section about creating lod billboards that react to lighting[/size][/color]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=3][color=#d8d8d8]And I link to the external source of 3D lods[/color] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56907?tab=files]Happy Little Trees Add-On - DynDOLOD 3[/url][/size]\n<br />[/list][size=4]\n<br />[color=#d8d8d8][size=3]I want to keep it as an external source to support the STEP community. And I personally think that this community is very important for Skyrim modding.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Additional Features:\n<br />\n<br />[color=#d8d8d8][size=3]The mod is shipped with a Treescale.esm.\n<br />This plugin makes most green and dead pines 20 percent larger. But you can also set your personal tree size.\n<br />Check the guide in the article section.\n<br />\n<br />A load order hint for this plugin!\n<br />The Treescale.esm should be as high as possible in your LO. Set it at least 1 position higher than USSEP. This avoids region naming issues and potentially overwritten worldspace fixes.\n<br />I did a lot of testing and this hint should be safe. But contact me if I'm wrong.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Updating to version 2.0:\n<br />\n<br />[color=#d8d8d8][size=3]The safest way is to uninstall the WIP, install the final and start a new game.\n<br />But you can use the DynDoLod method on your existing savegame too. Because you have to update DynDoLod anyway if you use it and you switch from 1.4 to 2.\xdf.\n<br />\n<br />Go into an interior. Save the game. Leave the game. Uninstall the WIP and your potentially installed DynDoLod creation (if you don't use DynDoLod then I recommend the same steps too). Install the final. Rerun DynDoLod (you can skip this step if you don't use it).[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Additional Installation notes:\n<br />\n<br />[color=#d8d8d8][size=3]I didn't had issues while I installed this mod and used an existing save game.\n<br />It should be save.\n<br />But you can always correct me if I'm wrong.[/size][/color][/size][size=4][size=3][color=#b6b6b6][color=#cccccc]\n<br />There come up additions from other authors to this mod.
