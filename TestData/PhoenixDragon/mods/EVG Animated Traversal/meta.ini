Help.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][i] Furniture in combat?[/i][/color]\n<br />SKSE. pls make dll for me ty\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][i]How does this work?[/i][/color]\n<br />I saw the Telvanni floating furniture animations and thought- what if we just change the location/time values and then swap the animation?\n<br />Then, just stick these in the world like any other animation marker. Easier said than done, but not the worst thing to make.\n<br />\n<br />Example:\n<br />idletelvannitower_floatup.hkx (4.6 seconds) (location z +1000)\n<br />EVG_vault.hkx (2.3 seconds) (location y +120)\n<br />\n<br />Now- we can't use the Telvanni furniture specifically, as the movement is baked into the behaviours, not the animation file.\n<br />Instead, we use Dynamic Animation Replacer to hijack another existing 'single use' animation in the vanilla game, that has no movement.\n<br />Then we use Animation Motion Revolution to add movement data to that new animation.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][i]Why not a real climbing system?[/i][/color]\n<br />can't code. i took an html5 class once. anyway. someone talented is working on one. keep ur eyes peeled\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][i]You have a ladder animation. Why can't you replace the ladders in the vanilla game?[/i][/color]\n<br />First- you can. Kind of. Creating furniture behaviour with multiple entrance and exit points is a ton of work I'm not willing to do though.\n<br />Anyway:\n<br />The vanilla game rarely, if ever, uses standalone ladders that actually connect to a playable area.\n<br />Many are just story set pieces in the sense that they are used as decoration, for mining, tall bookshelves, etc.\n<br />I genuinely cannot remember a single instance in the vanilla game where a ladder lead to a flat surface that the player could stand on.\n<br />A majority of them connect to a trapdoor, and function as literal teleports to another cell.\n<br />It probably is possible to activate furniture, then the said door, but would require more scripting- (delayed activation, perhaps?)\n<br />as well as cell edits. If you have the knowledge to make that work, be my guest.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][i]I'm a mod author, do I have to use this framework the way you did, with furniture and markers? [/i][/color]\n<br />No! you can literally use it however you want. the Modder's Documentation article is help for replicating how /i/ intended it,\n<br />which matches the way the telvanni float is used in the base game.\n<br />If you're a papyrus/SKSE genius, do. what. you. want.\n<br />copy paste the animations into another folder to replace others, make them trigger based on other actions, etc.\n<br />just require the main file so people still download this o_o\n<br />(it's needed anyway for the sounds to function.)\n<br />[i]\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4]No [/color][color=#f6b26b]FNIS[/color] [color=#a4c2f4]support?[/color][/i]\n<br />be a dear and share what mods you use that still require FNIS in the comments!\n<br />But no, vanilla behaviour edits are no longer possible with FNIS as they require the author to implement the patch, and they have retired.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][i]No Legendary Edition? [color=#93c47d]XBOX?[/color] Why Animation Motion Revolution?[/i][/color]\n<br />The only way to get new furniture animations is:\n<br />- FNIS/Nemesis, but with no motion data attached (so then it requires AMR, which adds motion data, but is only on SE PC.)\n<br />\n<br />- Adding new animations through ZBT, (Skyrim Behaviour Editor) then adding motion data, then merging behaviour with Nemesis.\n<br />\n<br />I've heard of XBOX porters using these finalized Nemesis behaviour packages as well.\n<br />\n<br />As of now, it doesn't seem to be possible to implement new furniture animations through ZBT.\n<br />There's just some missing piece when it comes to activating CK Anim Events. Other new 'types' of animation work, but furniture? Nope.\n<br />I promise you, I (and others) have tried.\n<br />\n<br />Lastly- this method is just so much easier to work with. I can freely test animations within seconds rather than waiting 20 minutes with every tedious step.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][i]You're requiring Nemesis and not using it for new animations, but rather DAR instead? ? &gt;:([/i][/color]\n<br />I understand why this seems odd, however:\n<br />[url=https://streamable.com/g89iqi]Here's an older clip from early development when I used FNIS &amp; Nemesis' built in furniture implementation[/url]\xfeff\n<br />DAR handled activation with 100% consistency, in comparison.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][i]Do you have a patreon? Any early access mods?[/i][/color]\n<br />I feel like I don't mod enough to do anything like a patreon. I have many hobbies, and my work ethic gets me burnt out every other month- \n<br />it's a vicious cycle LMAO\n<br />\n<br />There IS a donate button at the top of the nexus page, but please do not expect any updates or new mods in return. I'm just out here living [b]?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />Compatibility:\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a2c4c9][b]Innately Compatible[/b]\n<br />[/color]Other Nemesis Behaviour mods:\n<br />(SkySA, Paraglider, True Directional Movement, Combat Gameplay Overhaul etc.)\n<br />\n<br />Other Animation mods\n<br />\n<br />like.. everything tbh, this mod doesn't touch any existing systems!\n<br />\n<br />New meshes added use vanilla UVs, so they (should) work with your textures.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Adjusted/taken into consideration to be compatible[/color][/b]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47670]Immersive Interactions - Animated Actions[/url]\xfeff\n<br />\xa0- This allows you to physically interact with ground levers, unlike in vanilla. The Nemesis patch in this mod affects the lever animation duration which can look odd- but I ensured that it still 'worked.' Does the animation bother anyone? I wouldn't mind making a new one if it snaps too quickly.\n<br />\n<br />Sound Effect mods - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523]Immersive Sounds - Compendium[/url]\xfeff, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/21706239?tab=user+files]Satafinix Collection[/url]\n<br />Animated Traversal ignores these sounds, and uses a duplicate of vanilla sounds instead. This was done because many 'generic collision' sounds like bodies on surfaces, etc that I tried to repurpose for EVGAT didn't really match what I was going for in the animation compared to vanilla.[size=1]\n<br />(Some lighter vanilla body 'thumps' were much bassier and weighty in ISC for example- which is good, and works very well in game for the original intended purpose! I use it myself. The softer vanilla sounds just make more sense for climbing/drops)\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b][color=#ffe599]It'll look weird, but it's fine[/color][/b]\n<br />Destructible object mods - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28291]Destructible Skyrim - Breakable Objects (Beta)[/url]\xfeff\n<br />Unless this is taken into consideration by level designers, things that you climb on could be destroyed. It won't break animation triggers because they don't depend on these objects at all, but it'll just look weird.\n<br />\n<br />Procedural Leaning - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33767]CGO[/url]\xfeff/[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614] True Directional Movement[/url]\xfeff\n<br />Looks funny. I would turn it down to the lowest setting possible, imo, just a touch of it is good for me :\xa0 )\n<br />\n<br />Mesh replacers\n<br />An obvious one, if someone designs a climbing setup around specific objects and then those objects are changed to a drastically different shape, yeah it'll look a little weird.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f9cb9c][b]May cause issues[/b][/color]\n<br />Cell/Location/Interior/Exterior compatibility will be up to the add-on author using this mod.\n<br />No other mod I'm aware of touches the lever pulling systems, which is the only thing EVGAT edits directly. Nearly everything in this mod is isolated.\n<br />\n<br />Mods that drastically change the height of humanoids - Highheels, 'Lore-edits' to vanilla races\n<br />Character scale directly affects the animation, as well as multiplies the distance traveled per animation.\n<br />(the forced character scaling present in the vanilla game does not work on single animation objects, like Telvanni float. booo)\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5271]Rigmor of Bruma[/url]\xfeff - cell edit in the same spot as the Content Package ;-;\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#dd7e6b]Not compatible[/color][/b]\n<br />None noted.\n<br />[b]\n<br />[b]Add-On Mods, Implementation[/b][/b]\n<br />For widespread EVGAT use, existing furniture objects need to be swapped out for animation-enabled ones.\n<br />Please be careful with automated tool use. (Synthesis, Base Object Swapper) As many objects in the base game/mods are just used for decorative purposes, I cannot predict what happens if you interact with an oddly aligned static object.\n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />DAR Folder Numbers:\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[i]Grounded[/i]\n<br />6005000: Vault\n<br />6005002: Raider Roll\n<br />6005004: Duck\n<br />6005006: Squeeze\n<br />6005008: Deep Walk\n<br />\n<br />[i]Vertical[/i]\n<br />6005090: Medium Ledge\n<br />6005100: Ledge\n<br />\n<br />6005105: Generic Climb (Short Character)\n<br />6005106: Generic Climb\n<br />6005107: Generic Climb (Tall Character)\n<br />\n<br />6005110: Short Ladder (Short Character)\n<br />6005111: Short Ladder\n<br />6005112: Short Ladder (Tall Character)\n<br />\n<br />6005115: Tall Ladder (Short Character)\n<br />6005116: Tall Ladder\n<br />6005117: Tall Ladder (Tall Character)\n<br />\n<br />6005120: Tall Ladder Slide (Short Character)\n<br />6005121: Tall Ladder Slide\n<br />6005122: Tall Ladder Slide (Tall Character)\n<br />\n<br />[i]No Turning Back[/i]\n<br />6005201: Wall Drop Short\n<br />6005206: Wall Drop Far\n<br />6005211: Raider Drop\n<br />\n<br />[i]Miscellaneous[/i]\n<br />6005280: Failed Ledge\n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />Troubleshooting:\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Q: your mod isn't working\n<br />A: hi\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ea9999][b]Q: The animation works- but then it plays twice/ snaps back to a lever animation? / lever sound? / then stuck?[/b][/color]\n<br />You did not install the Nemesis patch.

If in another mod, that's on the author.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Sounds do not match the surface that my character is on.\n<br />A: Furniture animations remove collision from the player, and mess with detecting sounds.\n<br />Therefore, I added very generic, all-purpose sounds baked into the animation's annotations.\n<br />If you want accurate sounds, you'll need to make copies of the animation with different sound annotations and then do CK work to place them where they should be ingame.\n<br />\n<br />Q: I can move to stop the animation early.\n<br />A: done on purpose to fix bugs, trust me it's worth the tradeoff\n<br />\n<br />Q: My character does not align well with the animation.
