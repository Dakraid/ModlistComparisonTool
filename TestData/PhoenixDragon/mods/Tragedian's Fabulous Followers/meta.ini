nexusDescription="[size=3]A total rework for the visuals &amp; skills of Skyrim's followers with an immersive, lore-friendly approach. All of the affected NPCs have been given the ability to level alongside the player up to level 60 &amp; some have been given new combat perks so they can carry their own weight against whatever threats the Dragonborn may face.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://imgur.com/IgoZ3fB.png[/img][/center]\n<br />\n<br />This mod includes all of my previously released NPC overhauls, some of which I've redone to include\xa0\x62\x65tter tintmasks\xa0&amp; smoother meshes.\xa0My goal was to visually enhance each follower in a way that wouldn't look too out of place in the vanilla game, but still be unique &amp; reflective of their personality/background. This also extends to combat, with several characters gaining access to useful perks, abilities, equipment, etc. To see a more in-depth list of changes for each follower, click the spoiler tags below.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://imgur.com/oUd3gJN.png[/img][/center][/size][center][size=3][spoiler]\n<br />[/size][left][size=3][b]-- [u]ADELAISA VENDICCI[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Fighting Stance, Shield Wall (Tier 2), Well Fitted\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Adelaisa's new perks offer a modest boost to her damage &amp; defense.\n<br />[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0[u]AELA THE HUNTRESS[/u]\xa0--\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Critical Shot (Tier 2), Ranger, Quick Shot, Deft Movement\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Aela's offense &amp; survivability have been improved, allowing her to keep up with you in the late-game without being too overpowered.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0[u]AGMAER[/u]\xa0--\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Overdraw (Tier 1), Hack &amp; Slash (Tier 1), Fighting Stance, Agile Defender (Tier 2)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: I know Agmaer is meant to be rather green when it comes to combat, but Bethesda really gave him the shaft when they assigned his stats. I've only given him a much-needed boost so he can better assist you in the effort to stop Lord Harkon's plot.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]AHTAR[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Barbarian (Tier 1), Limbsplitter (Tier 2), Custom Fit\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]New Class:[/color][/b] Barbarian (Light Armor, Two-Handed, Archery, Block, One-Handed)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: I've replaced Ahtar's class with one skilled in Light Armor in order to compliment WACCF's changes to the Executioner's Robes &amp; offer him better protection while wearing his signature gear.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]ANNEKKE CRAG-JUMPER[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Overdraw (Tier 1), Critical Shot (Tier 1), Ranger, Quickshot\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: I've given Annekke a rougher, more mature look given that she's a miner &amp; has a fully-grown daughter living in Shor's Stone.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--[u]\xa0\x41RANEA IENITH[/u]\xa0--\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][b]Perks Added:[/b][/color]\xa0Light Foot\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][b]New Outfit:[/b][/color]\xa0Temple Priest Robes &amp; Boots\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: The default hooded robes just didn't do her justice. It's a simple yet lore-friendly change that I feel is fit for the Priestess of Azura.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0[u]ARGIS THE BULWARK[/u]\xa0--\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Deflect Arrows, Juggernaut (Tier 2), Well Fitted\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]New Outfit:[/color][/b] Dwarven Armor &amp; Weapons\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Clad in Dwemer plate from head to toe &amp; sporting several new defensive perks, Argis is the ultimate tank. His prosthetic eye is a prototype created by Calcelmo using ancient Dwemer tech found in the ruins beneath Markarth.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]ATHIS[/u]\xa0--\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][b]Perks Added:[/b][/color][font=Arial]\xa0[/font]Light Foot, Bladesman (Tier 1), Shield Wall (Tier 2), Agile Defender (Tier 2)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Athis is the self-proclaimed future leader of the Companions, but his combat skills were disappointing at best. I've given him a few perks to help round out his lackluster kit along with a new look inspired by the Ashlanders.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]--\xa0[u]BELEVAL[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Overdraw (Tier 1), Hack &amp; Slash (Tier 1), Agile Defender (Tier 2)\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]New Class:[/color][/b]\xa0Ranger (Archery, One-Handed, Block, Light Armor, Sneak)[/size]\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#9fc5e8]New Outfit:[/color][/b]\xa0\x44\x61wnguard Light Armor\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES:\xa0\x42\x65leval is the only female Bosmer that can follow you in the base game, but her Bandit class &amp; max level of 25 were very underwhelming. I've made her into a Ranger &amp; swapped out her default heavy armor for a light set instead.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--[u]\xa0\x42\x45LRAND[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b][b]\xa0[/b]Light Foot, Bladesman (Tier 1)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Belrand describes himself as a swordsman &amp; comes equipped with a blade. He now has the proper perks to reflect that.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]BENOR[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Barbarian (Tier 1), Champion's Stance, Juggernaut (Tier 2)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Benor's original appearance was a bit jarring &amp; reminiscent of a walking cartoon so I've adjusted his proportions, giving him a more grounded appearance.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]BORGAKH THE STEEL HEART[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Fighting Stance, Savage Strike, Block Runner, Well Fitted\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Borgakh gains a few useful perks to round out her combat capabilities &amp; reflect her frequent training.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]BRELYNA MARYON[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]New Class:[/color][/b] Conjurer (Conjuration, Restoration, Destruction, Alteration, Sneak)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: In the base game, Brelyna is a Mystic &amp; her stats favor Illusion, even though she has no Illusion spells. I've moved her to the Conjurer class because\xa0[i]the skill spread compliments her known spells &amp;[/i] the reason she came to Winterhold in the first place was to study Conjuration.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0[u]CALDER[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Barbarian (Tier 1), Limbsplitter (Tier 2), Custom Fit\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]New Class:[/color][/b]\xa0\x42\x61rbarian (Light Armor, Two-Handed, Archery, Block, One-Handed)\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]New Outfit:[/color][/b]\xa0Stormcloak Cuirass &amp; Steel Battleaxe\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES:\xa0[i]Calder is a proud Nord living in Windhelm &amp; although he may not be a Stormcloak himself, I imagine he empathizes with the plight of his compatriots.\xa0[/i]My apologies to anyone who might've liked them, but the mutton chops had to go.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0[u]CELANN[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Recovery (Tier 1), Regeneration\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][b]Spells Added:[/b][/color]\xa0Healing, Fast Healing\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][b]New Class:[/b][/color]\xa0Vigilant Dissenter (Heavy Armor, One-Handed, Archery, Block, Restoration)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: As a former Vigilant, I figured that Celann should have access to a bit of restoration magic beyond his usual Sun Fire spell. Now he'll cast a healing spell to recover his HP if it drops below a certain point.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]CICERO[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Stealth (Tier 2),\xa0Light Foot, Dual Flurry (Tier 1), Dual Savagery\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Cicero gains a bit of thematic makeup as well as a few new perks &amp; the ability to dual-wield.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]COSNACH[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Savage Strike, Agile Warrior (Tier 2)\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][b]New Class:[/b][/color] Rogue (One-Handed, Sneak, Light Armor, Block, Archery)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Markarth's resident drunk gets a more fitting class &amp; a few basic enhancements.[/i]\n<br />[/size][/size][/left][size=3]\n<br />[/spoiler][/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />[/size][center][size=3]\xfeff[img]https://imgur.com/w6As68l.png[/img]\n<br />[spoiler][left]\n<br />[b]-- [u]DERKEETHUS[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Overdraw (Tier 1), Critical Shot (Tier 1), Ranger, Quickshot\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: As the only Argonian follower in the game, Derkeethus deserved a little visual upgrade in the form of some sleek new fins. I've also given him a little boost to his archery skills.\n<br />[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0[u]DURAK[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: This grizzly Orsimer is already a competent warrior &amp; especially deadly with a crossbow in-hand. As such, a visual makeover is all that was really warranted.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--[u]\xa0\x45OLA[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Eola already boasts an array of powerful spells so she doesn't need much more than a few minor upgrades. Her new look is a bit more sinister &amp; alludes to the\xa0[i]Nightblade's\xa0[/i]cannibalistic nature.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0[u]ERANDUR[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Recovery (Tier 1), Regeneration, Augmented Flames (Tier 1), Magic Resistance\xa0(Tier 1), Bone Breaker\xa0(Tier 1)\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Spells Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Healing, Healing Hands, Fast Healing, Heal Other\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]New Class:[/color][/b]\xa0\x43leric\xa0(Restoration, Destruction, One-Handed, Light Armor, Heavy Armor)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: In the base game, Erandur's reputation as a healer isn't reflected in his skills or combat style. I've added several restorative spells to his repertoire\xa0&amp; custom, script-free AI that allows him to heal you. His stats have also been fixed so that his magicka will improve as he levels rather than staying at 50 for the whole game.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]ERIK THE SLAYER[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Savage Strike, Juggernaut (Tier 1)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Erik's appearance will now differ slightly between his pre &amp; post \"Slayer\" versions.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0[u]FAENDAL[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Stealth (Tier 1), Light Foot, Critical Shot (Tier 1), Bullseye\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Faendal's new visuals make him more in line with the Bosmer from ESO - i.e., antlers &amp; less pointed features. He now uses a stand-alone complexion &amp; his horns have been spruced up a bit with new textures.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]FARKAS[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Barbarian (Tier 1), Deep Wounds (Tier 2), Juggernaut (Tier 1), Reflect Blows\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: The added perks ensure this man-beast will have the bite to match his bark.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--[u]\xa0\x46REA[/u]\xa0--\n<br />\n<br />[/b][b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Spells Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Healing Hands\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: As a shaman, Frea has several healing spells at her disposal &amp; will now use them to aid you in combat thanks to the addition of custom, script-free AI.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]GOLLDIR[/u] --\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Golldir's one of the few vanilla followers who comes equipped with several perks by default.\xa0[i]Therefore, a visual upgrade is all that's needed.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]-- [u]GHORBASH THE IRON HAND[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Fighting Stance, Block Runner, Well Fitted\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Ghorbash is an ex-legionnaire\xa0&amp; spent his youth serving the Imperial army. As such, I've given him a few enhancements to reflect his combat training.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0[u]GREGOR[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Barbarian (Tier 1), Juggernaut (Tier 1), Well Fitted\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES:\xa0Like all those hailing from Dawnstar,\xa0[/i][i]Gregor is plagued by nightmares &amp; his appearance now alludes to that.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--[u]\xa0ILLIA[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][b]New Outfit:[/b][/color]\xa0Illia's Robes (-15% Destruction Spell Cost, +75% Magicka Regeneration)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Along with her new look, Illia gains a unique set of enchanted robes to augment her spellcasting abilities. I personally wasn't a fan of the generic blue robes she came equipped with &amp; wanted her to look visually distinct from the in-game hags, but still very much like a classic witch.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]-- [u]INGJARD[/u] --\n<br />[/b][b]\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Champion's Stance, Skullcrusher (Tier 1), Juggernaut (Tier 1)\n<br />[b]\n<br />[/b][i]NOTES: Ingjard has a pretty respectable stat spread, but her lack of perks made her less effective in the late game. Now she should be an adequate front-liner in the war against the vampire threat.\n<br />[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]INITIATE (FEMALE)[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Augmented Flames (Tier 1), Recovery (Tier 1), Regeneration, Magic Resistance (Tier 1), Custom Fit\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Spells Added:[/color][/b] Flames, Firebolt, Fast Healing, Steadfast Ward, Oakflesh\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][b]New Class:[/b][/color] Nightblade (Sneak, Destruction, Alteration, One-Handed, Light Armor)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: I wanted to differentiate the two Dark Brotherhood Initiates so they're no longer gender-swapped clones of one another. The female will fight with a mix of destructive magic &amp; melee attacks.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]INITIATE (MALE)[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Dual Flurry (Tier 1), Dual Savagery, Custom Fit\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: As befits an assassin, the male Initiate has been given the ability to dual-wield alongside a few perks reflecting his affinity for close combat.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]IONA[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Stealth (Tier 1), Light Foot, Critical Shot (Tier 1), Hack &amp; Slash (Tier 1)\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][b]New Class:[/b][/color] Ranger (Archery, One-Handed, Block, Light Armor, Sneak)\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]New Outfit:[/color][/b] Common Clothes &amp; Hunting Bow\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: I really felt the need to diversify the combat styles of each Housecarl so there would be a benefit to taking one over the other. When re-imagining Iona's role, I wanted her to come across as more of an infiltrator &amp; less of a meathead beatstick. Her female animations have also been restored.[/i][/left]\n<br />[/spoiler][/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />[/size][center][size=3][img]https://imgur.com/zBtB21a.png[/img]\n<br />[spoiler][/size][left][size=3]\n<br />[b]-- [u]JENASSA[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Stealth (Tier 1), Light Foot, Critical Shot (Tier 1), Dual Flurry (Tier 1), Snakeblood\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: The new perks give her more of an edge in combat, allowing her to keep up with you in the late game without being too overpowered.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]JORDIS[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Champion's Stance, Deep Wounds (Tier 1), Magic Resistance (Tier 1)\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]New Class:[/color][/b] Two-Handed Warrior (Heavy Armor, Two-Handed, Archery, Block, One-Handed)\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]New Outfit:[/color][/b] Steel Plate Armor &amp; Steel Greatsword\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: With an epithet like \"The Sword-Maiden\", I thought Jordis deserved a nice big greatsword to hack apart the enemies of Haafingar &amp; I've also given her a more protective set of armor to reflect Solitude's vast wealth.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]J'ZARGO[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Spells Added:[/color][/b] Healing, Healing Hands, Fast Healing\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Augmented Shock (Tier 1), Recovery (Tier 1), Regeneration, Juggernaut (Tier 2)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: J'zargo is overly confident in his magical prowess, but his combat repertoire largely consisted of spamming \"Sparks\" until he ran out of magicka. I've made some adjustments to his perks &amp; AI so that he'll be able to better support you in battle.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]-- [u]KHARJO[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][b]Perks Added:[/b][/color]\xa0Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Fighting Stance, Block Runner, Juggernaut (Tier 2)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Kharjo gains a few helpful perks to improve his combat prowess. I've also given him what I consider to be a more grizzled appearance, complete with luscious mane.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]-- [u]LOB[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Overdraw (Tier 1), Hack &amp; Slash (Tier 1), Agile Defender (Tier 2)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Lob aspires to be a prolific blacksmith like his mother &amp; the added perks reflect his familiarity with weapons &amp; armor. Physically, I wanted him to appear a bit younger &amp; less grizzled than the other orcs.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0[u]LYDIA[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Extra Pockets, Armsman (Tier 1), Juggernaut (Tier 2)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Lydia gains a modest boost to her damage &amp; defense as well as[i]\xa0\x61 little extra carry weight to better schlep your burdens around, as she's sworn to do[/i].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]--[u]\xa0MARCURIO[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]New Outfit:[/color][/b]\xa0Marcurio's Lucky Earring (+30 to Magicka)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Marcurio's faith in his ability to wreak arcane havoc\xa0is hardly misplaced. As such, he doesn't need much beyond a visual enhancement.\n<br />\n<br />[/i]\n<br />[b]-- [u]MJOLL[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Mjoll is yet another follower who comes equipped with several perks in the base game, therefore she just needs a bit of a makeover. I tried to stay true to her character, but add a bit more grit &amp; personality.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]--\xa0[u]NJADA STONEARM[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Shield Wall (Tier 2), Block Runner, Deflect Arrows, Agile Defender (Tier 2)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Njada's combat skills are pretty lackluster &amp; she's rather squishy for someone who's meant to be an expert in defense. I've given her several new perks &amp; boosted her health so she can properly tank for you now.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0 [u]OGOL[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Hack &amp; Slash (Tier 1), Savage Strike, Well Fitted\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Ogol has been hardened by the constant giant attacks on Largashbur &amp; has a rougher appearance as a result. As a follower, he'll do a bit more damage than before &amp; swing his trusty axe with greater ferocity.\n<br />[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0[u]ONMUND[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Spells Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Stoneflesh\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Recovery, Magic Resistance (Tier 1), Mage Armor (Tier 2)\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]New Class:[/color][/b]\xa0\x44\x65struction Mage (Destruction, Restoration, Alteration, Conjuration, Sneak)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Onmund's specialty lies in Destruction magic, so I've moved him into the appropriate class and given him a few upgrades to improve his durability.\xa0[i]As a Nord, he's quite proud of his heritage &amp; his appearance now alludes to that culture.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/i][b]--\xa0[u]RALIS SEDARYS[/u]\xa0--\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Ralis is already capable of dealing massive amounts of melee damage, can dual wield, and his perks are stacked! As such, he only gets a visual upgrade which, in my opinion, was sorely needed.

I've switched her to the Rogue class in order to reflect her\xa0\x61\x66\x66inity for blades &amp; light armor as well as her[/i][i]\xa0\x64\x65sire to train under Aela.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]-- [u]ROGGI KNOT-BEARD[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Barbarian (Tier 1), Agile Defender (Tier 1)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: I couldn't really justify making Roggi a seasoned warrior, but at the very least he deserved a minor boost to his damage &amp; defense.[/i][/size][/left][size=3]\n<br />[/spoiler][/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />[/size][center][size=3][img]https://imgur.com/XtE0KwX.png[/img]\n<br />[spoiler][/size][left][size=3]\n<br />[b]-- [u]SERANA[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES:\xa0Serana already comes equipped with several perks &amp; spells so she doesn't need much beyond a visual upgrade.

The new perks should allow him to perform effectively with whatever gear you decide to give him.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]-- [u]SVEN[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Stealth (Tier 1), Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Bladesman (Tier 1), Agile Defender (Tier 1)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Sven isn't known for his combat prowess, but rather his pretty face &amp; musical skill. Still, he should at least give Faendal a modicum of competition when deciding which one to recruit from a practical standpoint. I've given him perks in line with the Bard class from previous Elder Scrolls games.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]-- [u]TALVAS[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Talvas has custom normal maps for his Dunmeri scars that were made using Tempered Skins as a base. You might experience a slight neck seam if you're using a different body mod, though it shouldn't be an issue with most armors.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]-- [u]TELDRYN SERO[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Teldryn's combat skills were already pretty impressive so he only gets a visual change &amp; nothing more.\xa0Like Ralis/Talvas, he also has custom scars[/i][i].[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0[u]TORVAR[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Savage Strike, Block Runner\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]New Outfit:[/color][/b]\xa0Iron Armor\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Torvar's skills favor heavy armor so I've given him a set of corresponding\xa0gear. As Jorrvaskr's resident drunk, he may lack discipline, but makes up for it with an unrestrained approach to combat.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]-- [u]UGOR[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Overdraw (Tier 1), Critical Shot (Tier 1), Armsman (Tier 1), Savage Strike\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Ugor's new perks offer a boost to her damage output whether she's fighting at range or up close.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]-- [u]UTHGERD THE UNBROKEN[/u] --\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Barbarian (Tier 1), Champion's Stance, Deep Wounds (Tier 1), Well Fitted\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: I didn't want to stray too far from Uthgerd's original look, but I've refined her proportions a bit.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-- [u]VALDIMAR[/u] --[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Bone Breaker (Tier 1)\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: As a sorcerer, Valdimar is actually pretty unique amongst the Housecarls &amp; I wanted his look to reflect that by giving him the appearance of a grizzled battle-mage. I've also given him the Bone Breaker perk because Horksbane seemingly takes up a permanent slot in his inventory for most people &amp; he comes equipped with a mace by default.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]--\xa0[u]VILKAS[/u]\xa0--[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b]\xa0Light Foot, Champion's Stance, Deep Wounds (Tier 1), Juggernaut (Tier 2), Well Fitted\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Compared to his brother, Vilkas is a little tankier despite his size and is a bit more measured in his approach to combat. He'll have plenty of armor and use less stamina now when power-attacking.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]-- [u]VORSTAG[/u] --\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Perks Added:[/color][/b] Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Fighting Stance, Block Runner, Custom Fit\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTES: Markarth's resident mercenary gains a modest boost to his damage &amp; defense in addition to his upgraded appearance.[/i][/size][/left][size=3]\n<br />[/spoiler][/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][center][size=3][img]https://imgur.com/UEYwY75.png[/img][/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />The\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch[/url] is this mod's only hard requirement. NPCs will use whatever textures you have installed, but if you'd like your followers to look exactly like the screenshots, I highly recommend\xa0Tempered Skins ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7902]Male[/url] &amp; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8505]Female[/url]),\xa0\x45xpressive Facial Animations ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19532]Male[/url]\xfeff\xa0&amp;\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19181]Female[/url]\xfeff),\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28510]Mild Complexions[/url]\xfeff,\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1062]Brows[/url]\xfeff, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1067]Beards[/url], &amp; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34636]True Faces[/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size][center][size=3][img]https://imgur.com/3cRGbNe.png[/img][/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />It should go without saying, but this mod is generally incompatible with other mods that edit the same NPCs, whether or not they modify appearances. Most issues can be resolved via proper load order, but some problems may require a different solution. For more information, click the spoiler tag below.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][center][size=3][spoiler]\n<br />[/size][left][size=3][color=#ffd966][b]Q: \"Can this be flagged as an ESL to save myself a plugin slot?\"[/b]\n<br />[/color]A: I've pre-emptively compacted the FormIDs so you can easily add an ESL flag in xEdit if you want, but I'll leave that up to you.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][b]Q: \"Is this compatible with AE?\"\n<br />[/b][/color]A: As far as I know, there shouldn't be any issues. This mod was built/tested in SE &amp; only affects the included followers. There are no other edits that should be impacted by the Anniversary Edition.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][b]Q: \"Will this mod work with [Insert Follower Management Mod Here]?\"[/b][/color]\n<br />A: Yes. Either version should not conflict with any mod that affects follower functionality such as Nether's Follower Framework, Amazing Follower Tweaks, etc. However, if using the full version, I'd recommend leaving Erandur, Frea, and J'zargo's combat styles on the default setting so as not to override their healing ability.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966]Q: \"I have the gray/dark face bug!\"[/color][color=#ffd966]\n<br />[/color][/b]A: If you have an issue with dark faces, it's likely due to a conflict in your load order. To be safe, run LOOT &amp; make sure my mod's loose files &amp; esp are placed\xa0\x62\x65low any others that affect NPC visuals. You should also be aware that any mods which edit NPC records, even without changing their appearance, may also cause the dark face bug &amp; need to be patched. If you're still having issues, please check out [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/1034]THIS[/url]\xfeff article on how to solve mod conflicts before leaving a comment or bug report.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][b]Q: \"Why didn't my follower's skill levels change to reflect their new class?\"[/b]\n<br />[/color]A: You shouldn't run into this issue if you've started a new game. However, if you've installed during the middle of a save where you've already met/recruited them, you'll have to reset their levels to force the change. Select the follower in the console &amp; type in the following lines one after the other, with \"XX\" being the level cap you'd like to set for them:\n<br />\n<br />   [/size][code][size=3]setlevel 1000 0 1 1[/size][/code][size=3]\n<br />   [/size][code][size=3]setlevel 1000 0 1 XX[/size][/code][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />That should update their skills to the proper value.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][b]Q: \"The NPCs aren't wearing the new armor sets you gave them.\"[/b]\n<br />[/color]A: If you're experiencing this issue after installation, simply wait 24 hours in another cell so the game can reset their outfits. Alternatively, you can just select them in the console &amp; type in the following line to force an immediate change of clothes.\n<br />\n<br />   [/size][code][size=3]resetinventory[/size][/code][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][b]Q: \"Some NPCs have a big ol' neck gap!\"[/b]\n<br />[/color]A: A few characters have had their weights changed so you might see a visible gap when installing this mod mid-game. Select the NPC in the console &amp; type in the following lines one after the other, with \"XX\" being the character's modified weight:\n<br />\n<br />   [/size][code][size=3]setnpcweight XX[/size][/code][size=3]\n<br />   [/size][code][size=3]disable[/size][/code][size=3]\n<br />   [/size][code][size=3]\xfeff\x65nable[/size][/code][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />Athis - 30\n<br />Jordis the Sword-Maiden - 60\n<br />Njada Stonearm - 50\n<br />Ugor - 65\n<br />\n<br />That should permanently resolve any visual glitches for these characters.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][b]Q: \"Can you make a patch for [Insert Mod Name Here]?\"[/b]\n<br />[/color]A: You can request a patch in the forum tab. You're also more than welcome to create your own patch for this mod &amp; publish it yourself or request that I host it here, just know that I may not be able to provide further support for it.
