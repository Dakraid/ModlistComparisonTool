He will occasionally provide cynical commentary on quests from an Argonian as well as Telvanni perspective. While he has the air of Telvanni arrogance, he is quite relatable and friendly. A proud Argonian from Thorn, he will occasionally speak in Jel and reminisce on both Morrowind and Black Marsh. He currently has over 3700 lines and has a full commentary on the Main Quest, College of Winterhold, The Dark Brotherhood as well as smaller quests and parts of larger quest-lines. He has his own personal quest, with more to come!\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[center][size=4]\xfeff\xfeff[img]https://64.media.tumblr.com/935992b9b82fdb722b683384795e7bb1/ea11106ccfe46566-58/s400x600/7269f15895e9666e8779767a3bdfc2ecb16a8646.png[/img]\n<br />\xfeff[/size]\n<br />[size=3]Art by:\xa0[/size][size=3][b]macabre-changeling[/b][/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Features\n<br />[/b][/size][size=3][b]Spell Toggling[/b] - You may ask Xelzaz to use or not use certain spells.\n<br />[b]Potions[/b] - Xelzaz will create powerful and after you finish the quest \"A Lawman's Ambition\" additionally simple potions\n<br />[b]Food[/b] - Xelzaz can cook you two large and warm meals a day, and may occasionally hand you a snack.\n<br />[b]Book Reading[/b]\xa0- You may ask Xelzaz to read certain books if you or him have the book in your inventories.

I wanted someone who saw you as an equal. Not worshiping\xa0the ground you walk on, being edgy and mysterious or a love interest. I wanted a follower that was unique and could bring a new perspective on the world around him. I wanted a companion that would be a boon to you, not just for company, but also being genuinely helpful. This brought the addition of him cooking you food, as well as powerful potions. I intend to make Xelzaz much more useful in a balanced way. Such as having him identify ingredients for you or perhaps training you in alchemy. Xelzaz is intended\xa0to have interactions with all the base game content, as well as the Creation Club/AE content, but most importantly, I wanted him to have interactions with mods that I myself enjoy. I intend to have interactions with mods as I continue working on him, however content that is available to everyone has a priority. Xelzaz is my first ever mod for Skyrim, so I am still learning and getting better. I hope to make Xelzaz the best he can be, by getting experience and receiving\xa0\x66\x65\x65\x64\x62\x61\x63k.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Recruitment[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]You can find Xelzaz by the Southern Morrowind Gate. This is located east of Dayspring Canyon and north east of Stendarr's Beacon. Speak with him and he will introduce himself. You may find a note on the wall in the Bee and Barb talking about Xelzaz. If you pick up the note you get a quest to go find him. Once you agree to bring Xelzaz with you he can be asked to read you a book, if you or Xelzaz are carrying it. You can ask him about his past, his skills, as well as about his motivations. You can ask him once every 12 hours to cook you a random hot meal and every 20 hours a potion of your choice, this includes simple potions once his initial quest is completed. Xelzaz will scale with the player. Xelzaz's first quest is currently available, with more to come! He currently has full commentary on the Main Quest, The Dark Brotherhood and The College of Winterhold, but he will also provide full commentary on other smaller quests, as well as parts of larger quest-lines. An example of a fully commentated smaller quests is the Gildergreen quest. While examples of larger quest-lines\xa0\x61re the Imperial Legion up until the end of The Jagged Crown. Quest commentary is constantly expanding and requests/recommendations\xa0\x61re welcome! Head over to the posts section to find a list of all the quests Xelzaz has comments on.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Xelzaz's Backstory[/b]\n<br />[size=3]Xelzaz grew up in Thorn, north east in Black Marsh. As a child he proved himself to have the potential to be a very skilled alchemist. A Telvanni Tower Alchemist made him a hireling, as she had too much work to do herself. So he came on as her assistant. Xelzaz saw this as an opportunity to improve his skills. He'd have access to a lab as well as a conservatory and rare ingredients. He would move to Llothanis, in Tel Sul under Master Sul. Over the years climbed the ranks of House Telvanni, as the Telvanni in his tower grew to respect him and saw not only his skills be very useful, but also his abilities as an Argonian. Disease resistance, poison resistance, they could send him into Black Marsh to get things that would be far too deadly for any Dunmer to do. While the rest of House Telvanni views Xelzaz with distaste, his own circle held him in high regard. As it is with House Telvanni, Master Sul would end up assassinated, which would crush Xelzaz as he had gained so much respect for his Master. He moved to Port Telvannis, figuring the de facto capital of House Telvanni would be an excellent place to find a new Master to become a Mouth for, in order to advance. Of course this was not the case. People mostly just gave him simple jobs that he was fit for. He would then hear word of a Telvanni Master without a Mouth that did not have reservations against Argonians. Master Helseth Ren, who is away in Rivenspire to research the Ayleid Ruins of the Doomcrag. He therefore decided to travel to High Rock from Morrowind, and along the way he would do field research and network with people. Just as he crosses the border into Skyrim, he spots an adventurer approaching...[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Discord\n<br />[/b][/size][size=3]Xelzaz now has a Discord chat you can join!

I have tried to limit any comments that would indicate Xelzaz was there for any quests you completed without him, but some lines may have slipped through the net. I recommend that you turn around and speak with Xelzaz. Occasionally he will have something to say about the current quest you are on, the area you are in or other conditions. An example could be speaking to Xelzaz after or during some dramatic event in the Main Quest, or for example in Raven Rock or the Tribunal Temple where he will have new dialogue\xa0options.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Feedback\n<br />[/size][/b][size=3]Feedback is very welcome, if you run into any issues, have any recommendations, ideas or just have something to say, please feel free to get it touch on Discord or make a post here. Currently I plan on updating Xelzaz every time there is significant progress made, this would for example be the completion of commentary for a quest line or the addition of Xelzaz's own quests. I will try to keep updates common, but substantial.\xa0\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Current Potions\n<br />[/size]Potion of Become Ethereal - [/b][i]Become Ethereal for 20 Seconds | Useful for when you are falling off a cliff.\n<br />[/i][b]Potion of Fire Shield - [/b][i]Shroud yourself in fire dealing damage to nearby enemies and gaining 100% Fire Resistance for 1 minute.\n<br />[/i][b]Potion of Frost Shield -\xa0[/b][i]Shroud yourself in frost dealing damage to nearby enemies and gaining 100% Frost Resistance for 1 minute.\n<br />[/i][b]Potion of Windform - [/b][i]Take on the form of the wind.
