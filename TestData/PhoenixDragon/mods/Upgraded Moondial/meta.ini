nexusDescription="I never payed much mind to the the Moondial in Castle Volkihar's courtyard, until I heard Serana say when asking her\xa0[b]What's so special about the moondial?\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[i]\"Well, as far as I'm aware it's the only one in existence. The previous owners of the castle had a sundial in the courtyard, and obviously that didn't appeal to my mother. She persuaded an elven artisan to make some improvements. You can see the plates that show the phases of the moons, Masser and Secunda.\"\n<br />\n<br />[/i]It didn't look Elven to me, infact the texture I had at the time made the stone look more like rock, giving it a Ancient Nordic feel, defiantly not Elven.\n<br />\n<br />A quick search on the nexxus turned up just the right mod, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5790589?tab=user+files]Cunny[/url]'s [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34739]Better Volkihar Secret Entrance[/url]. It turned the stone parts into a bronze color metal, similar in tone to[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23125] aMidianBorn's Thalmorized Elven armor[/url], which I also use. Perfect!!!\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/34739755?tab=user+files]InonicDeath[/url]'s Retexture of the Moon Crest covers the parts of Moondial [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5790589?tab=user+files]Cunny[/url]'s Mod doesn't really do all that much with. So why not both???\n<br />\n<br />Well both include meshes linked to their own textures, using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/34739755?tab=user+files]Iconic[/url]'s meshes totally overrides [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5790589?tab=user+files]Cunny[/url]'s mod. Using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5790589?tab=user+files]Cunny[/url]'s meshes makes the 3 player placed moon crests [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/34739755?tab=user+files]Iconic[/url]'s until placed at which point they switch to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5790589?tab=user+files]Cunny[/url]'s. No problem I'll just drop [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5790589?tab=user+files]Cunny[/url]'s textures into Iconic's folder and done!!!!\n<br />\n<br />Not really [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/34739755?tab=user+files]Iconic[/url]'s meshes don't have the texture paths to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5790589?tab=user+files]Cunny[/url]'s environmental map, and the bronze color metal is shining Blue?? Time to get out the caveman club and do some smashing!!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Requirements -\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34739]Better Volkihar Secret Entrance[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5790589?tab=user+files]Cunny1975[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45788]Iconic's Moon Crest Retexture[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/34739755?tab=user+files]IconicDeath[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Installation -\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Install both of the required mods(order doesn't matter).\n<br />\n<br />Only option in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/34739755?tab=user+files]Iconic[/url]'s FMOD that matters is weather you want 2k or 4k Moon Crest textures\n<br />\n<br />Install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5790589?tab=user+files]Cunny[/url]'s Elven or Ebony version.\n<br />\n<br />Install the version of this mod that matches [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5790589?tab=user+files]Cunny[/url]'s and place it below both.\n<br />\n<br />I also use :\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37159]Skyrim Remastered - Castle Volkihar and Clutter[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3302086?tab=user+files]gochargers2156[/url]\n<br />\n<br />which must be placed above all 3, if you want to use all that mods clutter.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Uninstall\xa0-\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Click remove mod, all mods only use textures and meshes.\n<br />\n<br />Safe to install and uninstall at any time.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Credits -\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34739]Better Volkihar Secret Entrance[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5790589?tab=user+files]Cunny1975[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Thanks for making the Moondial truly Elven, and your many other mods.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45788]Iconic's Moon Crest Retexture[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/34739755?tab=user+files]IconicDeath[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Thanks for the awesome Moon crest rework and your many other mods.
