nexusDescription="[size=4][color=#ff0000][b]BLOODSTONE CHALICE REBORN[/b][/color] [/size][size=4]is a complete overhaul of the original vampire quest item. All new meshes and textures were created to fix the ugly distorted eyesore that was the original.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][url=http://s150.photobucket.com/user/Blue-Bolt/media/Skyrim/Bloodstone_Chalice_front.jpg.html][img]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s86/Blue-Bolt/Skyrim/Bloodstone_Chalice_front.jpg~original[/img][/url][size=4]\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=3]This mod was born out of a request. I was asked about whether the Dawnguard DLC Bloodstone Chalice could be retextured to improve it&#39;s appearance. Upon\xa0investigation, I found that a retexture wasn&#39;t going to help, because the original mesh was so oddly shaped, and the texture wrap so warped that even a detailed hi-res texture would still end up a distorted mess. I therefore, passed on the idea.\r<br />\r<br />Later on, I was contacted by Nazenn, who kindly offered to revise the poor chalice mesh. Nazenn was just as shocked as I was at the\xa0terrible\xa0quality of the original mesh. In Maya, a brand new design was created that\xa0\x61\x64heres to the original Bethesda concept. The new\xa0symmetrical mesh is a lot kinder to the texture wrap. The extreme shape of the chalice with it&#39;s\xa0protruding spikes and\xa0pinched in stem still create some distortions to the texture, but they&#39;re much less than the original. I did my best to maximize the details where the distortion was minimal.\r<br />\r<br />The original Bloodstone Chalice had a single texture set (diffuse and normal), and just added the swirling liquid effect after you completed the quest and dipped the chalice into Redwater Spring. In our new version, there is a separate texture set (and mesh) for the filled chalice. You will now see the\xa0liquid dripping down the sides.\r<br />\r<br />I hope people enjoy this collaborative effort between Nazenn and myself. Perhaps now, the Bloodstone Chalice will be a more worthy prize after your\xa0hard-fought quest to gain the Vampire Lord\xa0\x61\x62ility.\r<br />\r<br />Remember, this quest item is exclusive to the Dawnguard, so you need that DLC to use this mod. Textures are available in 2K and 1K versions, so\xa0\x64ownload whichever is appropriate for your setup. There is also a darker blood option for those who might use an ENB or SweetFX preset that makes the original texture too bright. Another optional file is included for those who would prefer to have the blood effect filling more of the chalice then the original design allows. \r<br />\r<br />Cheers,\r<br />Gamwich and Nazenn[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://s150.photobucket.com/user/Blue-Bolt/media/Skyrim/Bloodstone_Chalice_front2.jpg.html][img]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s86/Blue-Bolt/Skyrim/Bloodstone_Chalice_front2.jpg~original[/img][/url]\r<br />[img]http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s86/Blue-Bolt/Skyrim/Exclusive_to_Nexus.jpg[/img]"
