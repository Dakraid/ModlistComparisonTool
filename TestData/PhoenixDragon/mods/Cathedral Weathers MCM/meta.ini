nexusDescription=This will give you the ability to modify all of the options for Cathedral Weathers in an MCM menu and lets you remove the configuration spell from your character.\n<br />\n<br />World View:\n<br />These settings will apply the selected effect. The number selected tells the system how many times to apply the effect. Think of this as clicking one of the Spell Menu options X times in a row. These values will not take affect until you exit the system menu.\n<br />\n<br />Nocturnal Sight / Interior Vision:\n<br />This works the same and will adjust the Night and Interior lighting.\n<br />\n<br />Climate:\n<br />Can set the climate to Sombre which increases the probability of bad weather.\n<br />\n<br />Season Perspective:\n<br />When toggled it will make summers appear warm and winters appear cold.\n<br />\n<br />Cathedral Spell:\n<br />Will add/remove the configuration spell when toggled.\n<br />\n<br />Profile Save/Load:\n<br />If you have PapyrusUtil installed you can save/load your settings. This includes World View settings.
