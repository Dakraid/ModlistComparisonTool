Although this is a relatively small quest, my mod offers a much needed alternative ending to this... err... unusual vanilla quest.\n<br />[left]\xfeff\xa0[/left][b][left][/left][/b][b][left][size=3]Features\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/left][/b][list]\n<br />[*]Fully voiced new dialogues via carefully spliced vanilla lines\n<br />[*]The choice to refuse helping Svana embarrass Haelga (No more shaming Haelga, let the poor woman live her life in peace)\n<br />[*]Encourage Svana to stand up for herself OR brawl her \"cat-calling\" customers into behaving properly\n<br />[/list]   \xfeff   \xfeff- Tythis (aka the annoying customer) has 3 or 4 [b]new [/b]interactions with Svana. (Warning: this means undesired one-sided flirting/verbal harassment)\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff- \xa0Svana will try to ignore these for the most part, but will confess to you how annoyed she is at Tythis\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff- If you beat Tythis in a brawl or convince him to leave Svana alone, he will stop annoying her\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff- If you encourage Svana to stand up for herself, she will confront Tythis and threaten to cut off his most precious tool\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]By protecting her reputation instead of shaming her, you can now get on Haelga's good side\xa0\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*]Using your speech skill or your status as agent of Dibella, you might get to witness Haelga's Dibellan Arts for yourself\n<br />[/list]\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 - Short \"Fade to black\" funny screen with... voiced dialogue. (5 different variations! So much wow!)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 - This gives you a temporary \"Experienced Lover's Comfort\" bonus (Slightly better bonus than the normal version)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 - Get a Mark of Dibella that can be crafted into an enchanted necklace (offering 20% better prices)\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 - If Haelga likes you enough, you can get \"new lessons\" from her every 24 hours. Haelga has 5 funny voiced reactions to you coming back for more.\n<br />[b][center][/center][/b][center][b][size=4][size=4]\n<br />Video Showcase\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[youtube]EwPaWFgeQG0[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />FAQ\n<br />[/size][/b][/center][b]- Can I get all rewards from Svana and Haelga?[/b]\n<br />No, not all of them, siding with one or the other might result in different rewards.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Is this worth installing if I still want to go through the vanilla route?\n<br />[/b]I'd say yes. The original route is enhanced with a couple of additional dialogue choices and a extras. (Like the mini quest to have Svana stand up for herself against Tythis)\n<br />\n<br />[b]- I have a Haelga/Svana Waifu Skin Replacer, is this compatible?\n<br />[/b]Yes, I haven't edited the NPCs at all.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Anything this mod is incompatible with?\n<br />[/b]If there's any mod that edits this quest, it won't be compatible (probably). I don't know any though. In any case, placing my mod high in your load order should be OK for the most part. Just let other mods take priority if needed.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Is the USSEP patch in the optional downloads needed?[/b]\n<br />Not really in my opinion. I'm just offering it cause I know some of you are gonna ask for it and it's an easy one to make. If you have USSEP installed but you're not using the patch I added, the quest should still complete as normal (even if you choose the vanilla path) - USSEP covers some weird cases where the Dibella Marks you need to get from the Riften residents would not spawn. This is carried over in the patch, but like I said, vanilla path should still work without it. No need at all to download the patch if you're planning to choose the new paths and ignore the original vanilla \"shame Haelga\" way to finish the quest.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Do I [u]have[/u] to get intimate with[i]\xa0[/i]Haelga if I choose to side with her?\n<br />[/b]No, it's a completely optional dialogue choice. It's not a guaranteed part of the quest either. Haelga decides in the end. (Via speech check or if you're an Agent of Dibella yourself). Wearing an amulet of Dibella might also help here.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- My character is female, will Haelga be willing to \"teach me her arts[i]\"[/i]?\n<br />[/b]Yes, Haelga does not discrimnate.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- I'm married. Will my wife find out if I spend the night with Haelga?\n<br />[/b]In real life? It depends if she's looking at the screen while you're playing through the quest. In-game? No, but both effects do not stack with each other, so don't try to sleep with your waifu/husbando and then pay a visit to Haelga, you cheat!\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Is this mod explicit in any way?\n<br />[/b]No. There's a fade to black screen if you decide to spend the night with Haelga... During which\xa0\x61 couple of fun voice lines full of innuendos will play, but the fade to black screen lasts only 10 seconds AND all the sound files are vanilla sound files, so it cannot be that bad, [url=https://i.giphy.com/media/3oz8xLd9DJq2l2VFtu/200.gif]right[/url]?\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Any plans to make this explicit?\n<br />[/b]Yes, just search \"[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ]JayXXXerpa[/url]\" on LL to find the adult variation of all my Quest Expansions.
