nexusDescription="Made by my good friend who when asked to be credited said, \"God no. Actually, make sure you say I had nothing to do with it.\"\n<br />\n<br />Texture basis was from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45147?tab=description]Vanilla Hair - Salt and Wind[/url], which is a somewhat smoother alternative to the original Salt and Wind. Also consistent in appearance with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44975?tab=description]Salt &amp; Wind 1.7[/url] (hence the identical naming convention).\n<br />\n<br />Only new hairs added in 1.8 are included. Go get the 1.7 download for the rest.\n<br />\n<br />No normal maps included. You should be fine with the base.\n<br />\n<br />Compression format is BC7, so this won't work with LE out of the box. Not all hairs are pictured, all are included.\n<br />\n<br />Additional texture utilized from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/39159]Mr. Dave[/url] for Eivor hair."
