I also wanted to tackle some layout, technical, and pacing topics which I felt could make a good quest even better.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/23217/23217-1549522326-1737499338.png[/img]\n<br />A detailed spoiler-heavy changelist is [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/1367]featured in the articles section[/url].  Here are the spoiler-light highlights.[spoiler]\x25aa A simple narrative-only investigation has been added to the burnt house, including the ability to confront Hroggar about your findings.\n<br />\x25aa There is a new road to the graveyard, visible from the burnt house and Highmoon Hall.\n<br />\x25aa The pace of the questline has been changed and expanded to involve more player participation. Certain turns in the story require investigation, rather than happening automatically.\n<br />\x25aa Various narrative scenes and dialogues have been redesigned. NPCs have more to say and you have more you can say to them, based on what you have or haven't learned.[/spoiler]\n<br />[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/28973/28973-1568547205-1922744175.png[/img][/center]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/23217/23217-1549521938-2067913036.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />Please create a [b]manual save[/b] before installing this mod.  You'll need it if you wish to uninstall.  The packaged installer will walk you through your options and help you select the needed patches.\xa0 Mod Organizer 2 or Vortex is recommended.\xa0\x41ll plugins use the ESP-FE format.\n<br />\n<br />[b]When to install:[/b] To get the most out of this mod, it is best to install it before you've visited Morthal.  The quest \"Laid to Rest\" is invisibly active even if it has not yet appeared in your journal.  If you have been to Morthal, open the console with the ~ key and type [i][color=#cccccc]getstage ms14[/color][/i].  If the value it returns is 1, 10, or 20, then you're good to go!  If it's at stage 30 or higher, you may see some bugs and inconsistencies in the setup.  The farther you are into the quest when you install it, the more buggy it will be.\n<br />\n<br />[b]When to uninstall:[/b] As this mod deals with quest scripts with assigned properties which begin to run as soon as you launch the game, uninstallation will have unpredictable results.  It creates new permanent references which will stay in your save game even after the mod is uninstalled.  For best results, if you change your mind, revert to the manual save before you installed it.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/23217/23217-1549521957-499641895.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[b]Requirements:[/b]\n<br />  \x25aa The\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch[/url] for all of the fixes it provides\n<br />[b]Patches:[/b]\n<br />  \x25aa [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19592]The Great City of Morthal[/url] (and The Great Cities Merged), [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17536]Morthal Overhall II[/url], and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289]JK's Skyrim[/url] (SSE Merged Version only) are supported via patches.\n<br />  \x25aa If you're using a grass mod, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9005]Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods[/url] is highly recommended.\xa0Load\xa0[b]Finding Helgi and Laelette[/b]\xa0\x61\x66ter it.\xa0No other patch is needed.\n<br />  \x25aa\xa0\x41 patch for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424]Enhanced Lights and Effects[/url] is included.
