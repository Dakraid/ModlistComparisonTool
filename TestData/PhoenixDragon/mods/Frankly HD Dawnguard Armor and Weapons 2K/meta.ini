Includes all variants of the armor and shield; weapons including [color=#f6b26b][b]crossbow[/b][/color], steel bolts and the [b][color=#f6b26b]unique rune items[/color][/b]. The latter have been made more unique with a glowing lava effect.\n<br />\n<br />Vanilla normal maps were upscaled with a neural network software leading to much\xa0[b][color=#f6b26b]crisper and clearer details[/color][/b]\xa0than one normally gets with upscaling on traditional image editing software.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3][b][color=#f6b26b]Some meshes had to be modified[/color][/b] for consistent shader settings and to enable enviroment mapping on some meshes that didn't have it. It is therefore [b][color=#f6b26b]partially compatible with mesh replacers[/color][/b]. Specifically, this involves the weapons and some of the variants of the armor, like those that don't have pauldrons.\xa0Helmet replacers are completely compatible.\xa0That said, compatibility can be achieved very easily, there are some directions in the sticky comment.\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://www.mediafire.com/convkey/2d83/jfkgoz23ob8eq8zzg.jpg[/img]\xfeff[/size][/center]"
