nexusDescription="[size=5][b]Compatibility[/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Works with HLT 1.01 and 1.02betax.\n<br />[*]This add-on is incompatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53653]Fixed Mesh Lighting[/url] mod (if that mod ever updates HLT meshes), because that mod alters Lighting Effect 1 in the meshes, thus changing the CRC32 values. I will not be revising LOD models for any trees touched by that mod, since I am not convinced this lighting tweak is useful for at least some tree mods. My testing has revealed that these lighting tweaks trade off one small problem (slightly glowing trees at night) for a larger problem, depending on the trees (very dark branches in daylight on non-normal faces, but still some glow on normal faces).\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=5]Description[/size][/b]\n<br />These are DynDOLOD 3D hybrids for\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50961?tab=files]Happy Little Trees[/url] (HLT). Uploaded with permission from T4gtr34um3r to supplement his excellent custom trees. This mod will be a work in progress in response to any changes to HLT.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff]Quality version:[/color] [/b]3D hybrid LOD models created using the DynDOLOD toolbox. Copies of the crowns stripped down for LOD models with trunks converted to billboards (i.e., 'hybrids') for better performance. [color=#ffd966]For LOD to look right, this version MUST be used if using any of the Alternate textures of the main mod (HLT).[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][b]Performance version:[/b][/color] 3D hybrid models from the 'Quality' version were customized by T4gtr34um3r to reduce poly counts even further, yielding even better performance at a very slight cost of transition quality from LOD to full models. This version also comes with optimized LOD textures, so the file is larger than the Quality version. Recommended to eek out a few extra frames for those using mesh rules like 'Ultra' and 'Optimal' described below. These models will provide no performance gain when used as 3D billboards in mesh rules (as in the 'Performance' mesh rule below); HOWEVER, [color=#ffd966]this version does allow one to use 3D models at every LOD level without a significant performance hit. Because it uses custom textures, this version will not look right if using any of the Alternate textures in the main mod (HLT).[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#efefef][color=#00ffff][b]This mod adheres to DynDOLOD best practice by ...

The Optional File could also be merged or installed at higher priority.
