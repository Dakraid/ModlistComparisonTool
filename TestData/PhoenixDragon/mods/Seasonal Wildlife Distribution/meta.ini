nexusDescription="Seasonal Wildlife Distribution is intended\xa0to simulate hibernation, migration, and other effects of the changing seasons on Skyrim's wildlife, accomplishing this by adding unique sublists for each season. Consequently, it only affects leveled actors (i.e. wildlife generated from leveled lists); instances of specific creatures placed in the game will remain unchanged. In some cases, the effects are quite obvious (bear encounters will be very infrequent in winter, for example), but in many instances the effects are more subtle, and may only be noticed over the course of a playthrough (or several). In most cases, no creatures are completely removed from the seasonal sublists, but are instead reduced to very rare encounters as appropriate (bears in winter, for example). The list below highlights some of the more notable or pronounced changes, but is not meant to be exhaustive.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]In [color=#a4c2f4]Winter[/color]...[/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Encounters with all creatures become less common, with the frequency of such events dropping by about a third.\n<br />[*]Bear encounters become quite rare, as most are hibernating in their dens.\n<br />[*]Deer retreat to the forests, while the Elk congregate on the plains.\n<br />[*]Fox coats turn white in many instances, to better camouflage them in the snow.\xa0\n<br />[*]Predators from colder regions (such Frost Trolls, Ice Wolves, Ice Wraiths, and Snowy Sabrecats), sometimes travel down from the mountains and the Sea of Ghosts, and can be encountered in regions where they are not normally found.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=4][b]In [color=#bf9000]Summer[/color]...[/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Elk migrate to the forests and mountains, leaving the plains to the Deer.\n<br />[*]Fox coats darken, so as not to stand out against the now exposed earth and rocks.\n<br />[*]Skeever encounters become slightly more common, carrying through into autumn, as the plentiful food draws them out of their nests.\n<br />[*]Insects and arachnids (including Chaurus and Frost Spiders) take over the marshes of Skyrim, driving many other large predators away.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=4][b]In [color=#6aa84f]Spring[/color] and [color=#cc4125]Autumn[/color]...\xa0[/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]These are transitional seasons for many creatures and many of the changes described above can still be observed in a limited fashion.\n<br />[*]For example, as many bears are still in the process of waking from their long hibernation, they will be encountered less frequently during spring than they will be in summer or autumn (although still much more frequently than in winter).\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=4][b]How It Works[/b][/size]\n<br />Each vanilla leveled list used for spawning wildlife (which also includes creatures such as Ice Wraiths and Trolls) has had its contents replaced with four sublists; one for each season. At any given time, only one of these four sublists will be \"active\"; the other three sublists have their \"Chance None\" set to 100% via global variables. A script checks the game month once every seven in-game days and updates the global variables according to the changing seasons.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Recommended Mods[/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861]Seasons of Skyrim[/url] by powerofthree\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63623]Turn of the Seasons[/url] by Tate Taylor and Jelidity\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=4]Future Plans[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Patches (Beyond Skyrim Bruma, Birds and Flocks, Real Wildlife, SkyBirds, Skyrim Immersive Creatures)\n<br />[*]Seasonal color variants\n<br />[*]Seasonal size variants (to simulate younger animals in spring and summer)\n<br />[*]Seasonal aggression changes (hunger in the winter, mating seasons)\n<br />[*]Ideas/suggestions welcome\n<br />[/list]"
