nexusDescription="[b][u][size=4]Description:[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />This mod is a complete re-texture of Skyrim, Dawnguard and Dragonborn LODs.\n<br />Vanilla use 256 or 128 Texture for the Lods (with very unoptimized texture atlas). My mod offers you 1K Lods Texture for all the SSE worlds (Tamriel, Solstheim and all the small worlds like Blackreach). \n<br />Note that 1K texture for Lods is way less detailed and performance consuming than a regular 1K texture. For example a single regular texture will be for a single object like a door. For the Lods a single texture will be for several full buildings.\n<br />While this mod is working perfectly \"as is\" I can only recommand you to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59721]DynDOLOD [/url]by Sheson.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]New in V9[/b][/u] : Full Model for some child cities (Solitude &amp; Whiterun only) buildings. \n<br />When you are outside a city (and the city is INSIDE loaded cells) vanilla skyrim will use LOD models &amp; textures for its buildings (you see them less due to the walls).\n<br />Except Riften, Vanilla Riften buildings use full model Meshes (when you're near but not inside Riften). Why only Riften ? I don't know...\n<br />This mod now enable full model for all the buildings in Whiterun &amp; Solitude. Because they are technically NOT LOD!\n<br />\n<br />Many of the buildings textures are also improved and should be really faithful to what you can see with NobleSkyrimMod when you are near them.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][u]Installation :[/u][/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]There is two version of the mod, choose the one according if you plan to use DynDOLOD or not.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Install the standard version as a regular plugin.

Recommanded but not required. the mountains Lods will probably blend nicely with your mountain texture anyway. Both mods are\xa0 100% compatible just install HD LODs after Terrain Lod redone and you're good.[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=2][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1937/?]RUSTIC WINDOWS - 2K and 1K Textures[/url][/size] by Gamwich.
