nexusDescription="Riften is a city I have personally retextured 3 times. This would be the 4th. I haven't gotten it just right until now.\xa0\n<br />For me this is exactly how I would like Riften to look. I even took it upon myself to do some of the Ragged Flagon textures.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />I tried to stay lore-friendly but I did take some different creative directions.\xa0\n<br />The Ragged Flagon is just as dirty as ever, still working on a couple things for it but I like it thus far.\n<br />\n<br />Give it a try, you just might like it."
