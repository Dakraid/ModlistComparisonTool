nexusDescription="[size=6]Forewords[/size]\n<br />Project AHO is one of my favorite quest mods of Skyrim. No mod is without bugs, so I took it upon myself to make Project AHO even better experience for other players. You can check the Features down below to see what changes have been made. Big thanks to Dimonoider for allowing me to publish this and for creating Project AHO.\xa0\n<br />Link to the Project AHO can be found\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15996#]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Also for people wondering what ENB I use in my screenshots, it's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11660]Mythical ENB[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00]NOTE:[/color]\xa0Know that the changes made to AHO Playerhome are not visible in the earlier version of it. Once you receive the playerhome after completing the main quest, you'll see the changes. My mod should be compatible with any other AHO patches out there, though some mods like [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18645]Unofficial Project AHO Chains Patching[/url] are already part of my mod so you won't need them anymore. [b]Check Features below for more information![/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]Features:\n<br />[/size]\n<br />Version 1.7.1:\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Packed meshes, textures and scripts into BSA archive.\n<br />[*]Fixed a control console mesh with missing texture.\n<br />[*]Optimized flight control script: its menu should now work flawlessly now.\n<br />[*][b]People that only want the AHO playerhome can now do so.[/b] In Riverwood, behind Faendel's house you can find a small Project AHO logo-object. It will give you the AHO Control Cube, which you can use to summon the playerhome in one of its port locations (like Deep Folk Crossing). [color=#ffff00]NOTE:[/color] Once you do this, you can't go through the main questline anymore and won't have access to Sadrith Kegran.\n<br />[*]Snippy can now be put into sleepmode. There's a button on one of the pillars close to his spot in the AHO. Once pressed, Snippy will shut him down and can be reawakened by pressing the button again.\xa0[b]Make sure he's not following you (being a follower) while doing this![/b]\n<br />[/list][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.7:\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Flagged .esp as light plugin. [/b]It will no longer take space from your main plugins.\n<br />[*]Cleaned and optimized meshes connected to the AHO. Changed black colored vertices to white to make all objects fit better with new textures, making them cleaner.\n<br />[*]Re-decorated the flight control machine to reduce lag while looking at it.\xa0\n<br />[*]Improved textures: mipmapped and compressed. Filesize is now smaller and textures look much better in game.\n<br />[*][b]Merged with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/21056629]LordMala[/url]'s [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36915]Unofficial Project AHO Patch[/url].[/b] [b]You no longer need his patch, if you're using my patch[/b].\n<br />[*]Changed AHO ship model's blue textures to orange and also changed its light sources colors. (Let me know if it looks better or not)\xa0\n<br />[*]Edited/Added few new objects to AHO interiors.\n<br />[/list][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.6:\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Sadrith Kegran can now be travelled using AHO. [/b]The ship will take you to its origin location in the mycelium. Few environment changes have been made to this area to better fit the AHO inside it. (There might be some issues with the ship not moving all the way to the platform, but that's only a visual bug.)\n<br />[*]Bathhouse in AHO now has its own door activator buttons on the walls that can be used to open/close it.\xa0\n<br />[*]Created weapon holders for the Controller in the middle platform and for the Staff of Elements at the Multi-Faced's Tool.\n<br />[*]Changed Snippy's behavior as less wandering while not being a follower. This was made to reduce the chance he'll be blocking your path in narrow bridges.\n<br />[*]Filled up the small hole in the centre platform next to the glass spacer and made the cube activator look better.\n<br />[*]Fixed navmeshes all around the playerhome. Followers and NPCs should behave more normally now.\n<br />[*]Retextured the Control Cube and it's now called \"AHO Control Cube\". Retexture is applied to the cube activator too.\xa0\n<br />[*]Fixed Multi-Faced Tool's black vertices. It should fit much better to the environment now.\xa0\n<br />[*]Cleaned up some scripts and made the AHO flight menu a bit better.\n<br />[*]Changed the AHO entrance area at the Tower of Mzark Exterior area to feel less like a cage and more like a port.\n<br />[/list][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.5:\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Fixed the infamous bathhouse door bug, where it stops closing after 2nd activation of the activator. (Created a new script, polished and optimized).\xa0\n<br />[*]Edited bathhouse buffs to be more balanced/informative.\n<br />[*]Added more light objects and attached them to scripts + slightly more decorations.\n<br />[*]Created a new script for forge hatch to open when player walks up to the anvil.\n<br />[*]Edited the Multi-Faced Tool's script to allow player to sit on the throne and then prompt whether they want their appearance to change.\n<br />[*]Fixed some idlemarker positions.\n<br />[*]Cleaned the .esp.\n<br />[/list][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.0:\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Combined two other mods together: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18645]Unofficial Project AHO Chains Patching[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29919]Project AHO - Smelter Patch[/url]. (So SMIM chains and a new smelter mesh). [b]You will not need these two patches after installing my mod[/b].\n<br />[*]\xfeff\x41\x64\x64\x65\x64 new decorations: few additional chests, two new mannequins, lots of static objects and a few new objects to the playerhome.\n<br />[*]Playerhome now comes with its own Typewriter.\n<br />[*]Fixed ENB error happening with the Alchemy Lab windows in the Playerhome as well as in the food storage room. (This happened to some of the players, including myself)\n<br />[*]Slightly altered the auction starting scene NPC positions to fix pathing issue with the guard not able to reach the argonian. (Again, happened to some people, myself included)\n<br />[*]Added idlemarkers for followers and other NPCs in the playerhome.\n<br />[*]Created 4k textures for metaltiles, controlleritem and ship's centerpiece. Re-textured the control panel with 4k textures with new rune from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6359]Daedra-tastic Rune Spells[/url]\xa0\x61nd also re-textured the blue marble texture seen all around the insides of the ship.\n<br />[*]Edited UV maps of the object meshes to match better with HD textures. Also changed textures to some meshes.\n<br />[*]Armors and weapons can now be tempered.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]Things to do:[/size][list]\n<br />[*]Add new locations to travel with the AHO.\n<br />[*]Create a \"build-your-own-house\" mechanic to travel locations??? (You'd have to build the platform in order to access that location with AHO)\n<br />[*]Merge other AHO patch mods together in this mod???\n<br />[/list]\n<br />If you have any suggestions, write them to the comment section or send me a private message!\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Same goes for bugs and compatibility issues!\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]Compatibility and Other mods:[/size]\n<br />People have created many compatibility patches and additions for Project AHO. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00]NOTE[/color]: If you're using these compatibility mods, load them after my patch!\n<br />\n<br />Here are some of them:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16564]Project AHO - Spell Crafting Patches[/url] - Adds spell tomes to be crafted at the Typewriter from popular spell mods.\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20015]Project AHO - SOS - CTD fix[/url] - Fixes game crash for people using Schlongs of Skyrim mod.\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24997]Project AHO - Skytest Patch (Fix Invisible Mudcrabs)[/url] - People using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1104]Skytest - Realistic Animals and Predators[/url] may see most of the mudcrabs invisible.
