You just crawled out of a draugr crypt with all your precious treasures. You want to go home. \n<br />\n<br />You open your map, and ugh! You can't see! The moon may be shining bright, but your map looks as dark as Alduin's hide! Why does the map always have to be experiencing bad weather?\n<br />\n<br />[u]The following weather tweaks have been applied to improve visibility of the map:[/u]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Volumetric lighting has been added to the map. The sun and moon more visibly lights up the scene.\n<br />[*]Fog has been removed from the map in its entirety.\n<br />[*][i][color=#cccccc]Why there be clouds on my map???!!![/color][/i] Removes all clouds from the map.

With the addition of mods that add other worlds, as well as this mod's additional world maps, it can be noticed that it is rather strange for all of them to display the same map weather. Thankfully, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59919]Unique Map Weather Framework[/url] by doodlez allows mod authors to customize their maps weather however they please. The following maps have had a weather change to better their appearance:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Blackreach is underground, so it has no sunlight, no clouds, and no sky.\n<br />[*]The Soul Cairn is an other-worldly place that is dark and has a very purple sky.\n<br />[*]Solstheim has a more ashen look.\n<br />[*]The Forgotten Vale is mostly similar to Skyrim, but slightly colder.\n<br />[*]Skuldafn is in Skyrim, but up in the mountains, so it is almost identical to Skyrim, but slightly cooler.\n<br />[*]Sovngarde is rather dark and very blue.\n<br />[*]Lastendell (from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28120]Midwood Isle[/url]) is very similar to Sovngarde: dark and blue.\n<br />[/list][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#76a5af][size=6][b]DynDOLOD Rules[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[i]\"Have you seen that Shrine of Azura?
