You can learn more about them\xa0[url=https://afkmods.iguanadons.net/index.php?/topic/5079-plugin-files-and-you-esmeslesp/]here[/url]\xfeff. They have advantages and disadvantages which I will list here. The best reason to use esl files is that they don't count towards the maximum plugin limit, which is very useful for people that have crowded (200+ plugins) load orders. The problem with them is that\xa0they always lose conflicts with esp files.\xa0In the case of this mod, that means that if you use the esl version and have any other plugins that touches exploration and dungeon music types, you will not hear the new music.\xa0[b]This is why I recommend only advanced users and users already familiar with ESL files use the ESL version.[/b][b]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[size=3][b]=============================\n<br />PERMISSIONS\n<br />=============================[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />You can use the tracks in any video (monetized or not) if you credit me (leaving a link to the mod in the description is enough). You can use the tracks in any mod as long as you credit me and leave a link to the mod in your description.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]=============================\n<br />STORY TIME\xa0\n<br />=============================[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />So, Still wasn't originally meant to be music for Skyrim. It's an ambient music album that I wrote, exploring ambient orchestral music and focused on musical and natural textures hence the nature sounds in the preview video. The album was obviously very heavily inspired by the Skyrim OST and even more by Jeremy Soule's Northerner Diaries.\n<br />Ultimately, the tracks fit very well with the Skyrim OST, which is why I decided to create this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]=============================\n<br />ABOUT ME\n<br />=============================[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />I am a composer, and have been for about a decade now. I am also a huge fan of mods and video games, and love making music for those. You can hear some of my other work in\xa0[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68406/]Summerset Isle[/url] by yourenotsupposedtobeinhere.\n<br />I have written the soundtrack for two video games:\xa0[url=https://captaincreepy.bandcamp.com/album/lost-past-soundtrack]Lost Past[/url]\xfeff and\xa0[url=https://captaincreepy.bandcamp.com/album/20000-lieues-sans-la-mer]20 000 lieues sans la mer[/url]\n<br />You can hear some of my personal work on my\xa0[url=https://captaincreepy.bandcamp.com/]Bandcamp[/url]"
