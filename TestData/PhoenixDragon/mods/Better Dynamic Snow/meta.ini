nexusDescription="[center][color=#9fc5e8][size=6]\xfeff\x42\x65tter Dynamic Snow SE[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=4]Does it look like someone took a paint brush to your \"snowy\" objects?\n<br />Then toss your paint brush and get Better Dynamic Snow*!\n<br />[/size][size=1]* 100% organic and non-GMO[/size][/center]\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#9fc5e8][size=6]DESCRIPTION[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The original mod for Skyrim can be found in The Ruffled Feather here: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11/?[/url][/center]\n<br />\n<br />Better Dynamic Snow SE leverages the projected snow textures to add new features and even more immersion to give the world a much greater lived-in feel. We felt this was the right thing to do being that BDS has kind of grown long in the tooth with the addition of the projected snow feature in SE. The old version of BDS will remain available to those that need or prefer it.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]3.0+ Features[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Revamped farmhouses inspired by No Snow Under the Roof!\xa0\x41s such, snow is mostly removed under overhangs and balconies, which gives a feeling that the people of Skyrim now care for and look after their properties. However, exposed areas and roofs now have more overall snow coverage due to harsh environmental factors.\xa0\n<br />[*]BDS improves snowy walkways to make them look like they are, well, in use. In vanilla Skyrim the walkways are a solid blanket of snow, like they have never been walked on. BDS adds less snow on walkways outside of more public places (such as stores, for example). Other walkways will have slightly more snow because they aren't used quite as much.\n<br />[*]BDS fixes lingering issues that were never fixed by any patch or mod on the included meshes. This includes fixes for texture stretching, flickering issues, and more.\n<br />[*]Since all BDS is using are the projected textures and performance-free mesh edits, it will be performance friendly.\n<br />[*]A projecteddiffuse.dds replacement for vanilla that is softer and blends better vs vanilla.\n<br />[*]Flexible installation options provided via the installer.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#9fc5e8][size=6]COMPATIBILITY[/size][/color][/center]\n<br />[b][size=4]Better Dynamic Snow is compatible with the following:\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Any mod that does not conflict with the included meshes.\n<br />[*]Most snow re-texture mods (via alternative plugin).\n<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659/?]SMIM[/url] (users should overwrite SMIM)\n<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11052/?]Majestic Mountains[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11052/?][/url][/list][b]\n<br />Note:[/b] BDS is somewhat not compatible with No Snow Under the Roof. You may still be able to mash both mods together for placed objects like snow piles, for example. This is untested though, and we won't be testing it ourselves.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Meshes[/size][/b]\n<br />All our included meshes are based from SMIM. BDS should win all mesh conflicts, else incompatible meshes will not display the projected textures as desired.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Textures[/size][/b]\n<br />BDS requires a snow texture found in [i]textures&#92;effects[/i] called [i]projecteddiffuse.dds[/i]. We have included our own texture that is meant as a replacement for vanilla. This texture can be replaced by any other mod, but the results will vary based on the texture installed.\n<br />\n<br />The [i]projectednoise.dds[/i]\xa0is a required file and users should [b]NOT[/b] overwrite it with any other mod. BDS was designed around this texture.\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#9fc5e8][size=6]INSTALLATION[/size][/color][/center]\n<br />Installing BDS is very simple:\n<br />\n<br />[b]Choose your version:[/b]\n<br />If you are using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31963]SSE Parallax Shader Fix (BETA)[/url]...\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]...download the Miscellaneous File ([i]Better Dynamic Snow SE v2.11.0[/i]). Only this old version will work with this mod.\n<br />[/list]If you aren't using the mod above...\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]...download the Main File ([i]Better Dynamic Snow SE v3[/i])\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[i][color=#ffff00]No, the changes from v3 will not be backported to v2.[/color][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Using your mod manager, download the file needed and run the installer.\n<br />[*]Install the mod selecting the options desired.\xa0\n<br />[*] Sort with LOOT.\n<br />[*]Ensure\xa0[b]bEnableProjecteUVDiffuseNormals=1[/b]\xa0is set in [i]SkyrimPrefs.ini[/i] file.\n<br />[*]Users will have to generate LOD using xLODGen or DynDOLOD, when upgrading from v2 to v3.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#9fc5e8][size=6]TROUBLESHOOTING[/size][/color][/center]\n<br />[b][size=4]Known Issues\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[/b][b][size=3]No Glacier Snow Option[/size][/b]\n<br />Currently, there is an issue if a user\xa0installs the \"No Glacier Snow\" option and decides\xa0to uninstall it in a specific situation. If a user installs this option, saves the game in an exterior cell with glaciers loaded, uninstalls this option by reinstalling the mod and skipping the option, and then loads that save, the glacier's previous state will be cached ([i]users will still see no snow on the glaciers[/i]). This is expected game behavior for such objects. They will resolve themselves once the cells containing glaciers are unloaded.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Game SSAO (Screen Space Ambient Occlusion)[/size][/b]\n<br />The game's SSAO can cause shadowy spots on the farmhouse rooftops during certain lighting conditions. So far, we haven't found anything we can do about this. Users can either learn to live with it or turn off the game's SSAO.\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[center][url=https://forum.step-project.com/topic/14577-dark-distant-mountainssnow-lods/][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/9121/9121-1609145522-1697866160.jpeg[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[/url][/center][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#9fc5e8][size=6]FEATURED[/size][/color][/center]\n<br />[b]BDS featured by Lakebit:[/b] [url=http://www.lakebit.com/7-mods-that-make-skyrim-beautiful/]Article[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[b][i]If you'd like your media approved when submitting to this mod, please ensure the media actually covers the mod![/i][/b]\n<br />Media that does not showcase the mod in any form (e.g. 'lets plays' that briefly show a snowy area, but 90% of the video is not) will not be approved.
