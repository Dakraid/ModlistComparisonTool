nexusDescription="Note: For Skyrim Special Edition the other features of the Inigo MCM mod are now built into the Inigo mod itself and the configuration options are available through console commands.\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.2 ensures an invalid key choice isn't registered (generating an error). You can now change the default code by editing the ESP file with SSEEdit (see the second image) but you'll still need a key code number and the easiest way to find that is using the console command to choose a key then typing \"sqv InigoWhistleKey\" to view the code that gets used.\n<br />\n<br />There's also now an alternate version that uses V as the default instead of X.\n<br />\n<br />[b]The Whistle Hotkey[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The Whistle Hotkey (default of X) allows you to communicate with Inigo (after you've learned how to whistle to him) and still use your shouts and other powers without fear that you will forget to swap them back and accidentally Shout at someone when you meant to Whistle to Inigo.\n<br />\n<br />In addition to the normal whistle features, if you use the hotkey while you have a chair in the crosshairs Inigo will see that you want him to sit down without you needing to manually activate the chair. (That's a very minor convenience because you can get the same effect from the whistle power by looking down, whistling, then clicking on the chair.)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Changing the Hotkey\n<br />[/b]\n<br />To change the key used you will need to use the console command:\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 [code]setpqv InigoWhistleKey code 1[/code]\n<br />\n<br />You will then be prompted to press the new key you wish to use. Alternately if you know a particular scan code for a particular key you can use that value instead of 1. (The X key is code 45.) You can also completely disable the hotkey by passing a code of 0.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Potential Mod Conflicts\n<br />[/b]\n<br />None other than other SKSE mods which might use the same key, but you can remap the Whistle Hotkey or even disable it if you like."
