These are not random royalty-free tracks packed together to make a quick mod. [b]They were written specifically for Skyrim and have its atmosphere, world and general vibe in mind[/b]. The music here is designed to fit within the vanilla Skyrim tracks. [b]TL:DR, no dubstep, metal, trance or overly cheesy orchestral tracks, ect...\n<br />[/b]It's worth noting however that these tracks do have some differences to the vanilla combat tracks. [b]These are more agressive, have more punch and are more fast paced than the vanilla tracks, while still being able to fit with them[/b]. Think of them as being in between the regular combat tracks and the boss ones in term of intensity.\n<br />[b]The mod does not override any vanilla music and is compatible with\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3868]Combat Music Fix[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />[size=3]Hun Lovaas is compatible and intended to be used with\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19401]Still[/url], my exploration music mod,\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30014]Melodies of Civilization[/url]\xa0my city and castle music mod as well as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36144/]Around the Fire[/url]\xfeff, my tavern music mod.\n<br />[b]I've also made\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48613/]Dawnguard Music Overhaul[/url], which expands on that DLC's soundtrack!

Without it, the new tracks won't play at all. Use the basic version. [b]If you plan to endorse my mod at all, please also endorse Personalized music.[/b]\n<br />- Download and install Hun Lovaas, either through your favorite Mod Mananger, or manually.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]*Notes for ESL version*[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />ESL are a relatively new plugin format added to Fallout 4 and SSE. You can learn more about them\xa0[url=https://afkmods.iguanadons.net/index.php?/topic/5079-plugin-files-and-you-esmeslesp/]here[/url]\xfeff. They have advantages and disadvantages which I will list here. The best reason to use esl files is that they don't count towards the maximum plugin limit, which is very useful for people that have crowded (200+ plugins) load orders. The problem with them is that [b]they always lose conflicts with esp files. [/b]In the case of this mod, that means that if you use the esl version and have any other plugins that touches combat music types, you will not hear the new music. [b]This is why I recommend only advanced users and users already familiar with ESL files use the ESL version.[/b]\n<br />[size=3][b]\n<br />=============================\n<br />PERMISSIONS\n<br />=============================[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />You can use the tracks in any video (monetized or not) if you credit me (leaving a link to the mod in the description is enough). You can use the tracks in any mod as long as you credit me and leave a link to the mod in your description.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]=============================\n<br />ABOUT ME\n<br />=============================[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />I am a composer, and have been for about a decade now.
