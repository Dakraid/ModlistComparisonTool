The mod comes with a short quest to acquire the home before the player will need to restore the building to its former glory, including the exterior and interior. Depending on your play style, M\xf6rskom can be rebuilt using skill and materials or through the use of paid workers. M\xf6rskom Estate isn't your average player home as it comes with many customisable features and immersive interactions, from lighting your fireplace to making your mead.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=6][b][color=#76a5af]M[/color][/b]OD [b][color=#76a5af]S[/color][/b]TORY[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]As many of you are already aware, M\xf6rksom Estate was originally a collaboration project between myself and [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3231858?tab=user+files]Elianora[/url][size=4] which was released way back in October of 2014 winning Brodual's house mod of the year. In total, the mod received over 100,000 unique downloads on the Nexus. Fast forward six years and the new M\xf6rskom Estate is being released for legacy and now the Special Edition of Skyrim.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Roughly a year ago, I started work on rebuilding M\xf6rskom from the ground up after being prodded by some members of the community to port the mod over to Special Edition. Initially, I refused to allow anyone else to convert and upload it on our behalf as the mod had become so huge that loading it in the Creation Kit caused the entire program to crash. As successful and ambitious as the project was, it had its issues. After hyping everyone up and then abandoning the new version, I returned to the project with a newfound passion for M\xf6rskom Estate.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Elianora has moved on to Fallout 4 modding and creating exciting new content for the Creation Club, so I went it alone and used my past 8 years of modding experience to rebuild M\xf6rskom Estate almost from the ground up. The result is a far more immersive and fitting house for the side of Dawnstar including many of the much-loved features of the old edition without the bugs and performance issues. The mod has changed greatly, but I think you'll be happy with the changes and the final results.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][color=#76a5af][b]V[/b][/color]IDEOS[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]USV8ic0Gf-E[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#76a5af][size=6][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4056][color=#76a5af]FAQ ARTICLE HERE[/color][/url]\xfeff\xfeff[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][b][color=#76a5af]S[/color][/b]PECIAL[b][color=#76a5af] T[/color][/b]HANKS[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]For a full list of credits, see the section at the top of the mod page. The following are specials thanks to those involved with the project.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]The first isn't so much a thank you but a recognition of the part [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3231858?tab=user+files]Elianora[/url][size=4] played in the original creation of M\xf6rskom Estate. She's a wizard when it comes to design and I could never hope to be as talented as she is when it comes to interior clutter.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Next up we have my amazing partner [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/8345545?tab=user+files]simsim899[/url][size=4] who has stuck with me through another insane project which has sucked up many of my hours. She's been my rock and continues to be supporting me in all of my mod projects, along with giving a helping hand on some meshes when needed.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]I would also like to thank [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/8497010]Phayntom[/url][size=4] for putting up with my insanity and being a good friend to talk to and share ideas with throughout the majority of the project. You can thank him for prodding me to rebuild it in the first place and encouraging me to continue it.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Many thanks also go to [/size][url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-cLeiadXfP-AzlqUV-rluw]The_Dog_Of_War[/url][size=4] who created the organ music at the start of this mod along with the soundtrack for the new trailer. He did an amazing job coming out of his comfort zone with the music genre I needed and I couldn't be more grateful.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Of course, I have to thank those of you (you know who you are) who have been watching my live streams through not only the creation of M\xf6rskom Estate but my other projects too. You all keep me focused and continue to provide me with honest feedback on the content I create.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=6][b][color=#76a5af]O[/color][/b]LD [b][color=#76a5af]E[/color][/b]DITION[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]For those of you who would still like to use the old edition of the mod or have a save game that requires it, you can still find it in the old files section of the legacy mod page. I see no reason as to why you would want to convert the old edition to Special Edition so this is not available officially. Please do be aware that this is a completely new version of the mod and requires you to completely replace the old edition or add this new edition on a new save. You cannot perform an upgrade from the old to the new.[/size]\n<br />[/font][/center]"
