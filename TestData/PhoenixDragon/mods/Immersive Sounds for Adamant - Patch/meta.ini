nexusDescription="[b][size=4][color=#e69138]Features[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This patch adds the sounds from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523]Immersive Sounds - Compendium[/url] to the spells and weapons from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839]Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul[/url]. It not only resolves conflicts between records edited by both mods, but also edits the new spells and weapons from Mysticism to be consistent with the changes in Immersive Sounds - Compendium. Many stronger spells will be more aurally distinct from their weaker counterparts, and spells with unique sound effects will share sounds with their stronger, higher-level versions.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][color=#e69138]Installation\n<br />[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />Download and install through your favorite mod manager. It is completely safe to install and uninstall this mod mid-save. This mod is ESL-flagged and will not take up a slot in your plugin limit. Requires both [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523]Immersive Sounds - Compendium[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839]Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul[/url] for the main version. Another version is added for compatibility with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191]Adamant - A Perk Overhaul[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Make sure this patch is loaded after both Mysticism and Immersive Sounds - Compendium.\n<br />\xfeff\n<br /> [size=4][color=#e69138][b]Compatibility[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />This mod will not be compatible with any mod that edits the same records. Please check for conflicts in xEdit, or put your faith in Mator Smash if that's your kind of thing. This is compatible with the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36761]AOS - ISC Compatibility Patch[/url] as it lets ISC handle magic sounds.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#e69138][b]Acknowledgements[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/color][/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files]SimonMagus616[/url]\xfeff for Mysticism.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3222912?tab=user+files]lazyskeever[/url] for Immersive Sounds - Compendium.\n<br />SimonRim Discord server for their help with modding and also for being cute."
