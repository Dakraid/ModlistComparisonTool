nexusDescription="[center][font=Courier New][size=3]I've been steadily working to replace basically all the textures in Skyrim with new ones. This is an ambitious project and will take me some time to finish.\n<br />[/size]I try my absolute best to stay lore-friendly and still keep textures the highest quality.\n<br />I'm working on including a mod list as I have had multiple people ask me to do so.\n<br />I will include in this list a few simple mods that will make a world of difference to your game.\n<br />Working on adding everything to the mod list - I am adding stuff as I go/remember. These mods also compliment my texture pack well.\n<br />\n<br />This is not a one stop shop for all of my mods. This is it's own thing, sometimes I include my other mods but I usually change a few things when it gets included here.\n<br />This mod is constantly evolving.\n<br />[size=6][u]The List\n<br />[/u][/size]\n<br />[b][size=3]-Weather and Lighting-[/size][/b]\n<br />1. Obsidian Weathers and Seasons\n<br />2. ELFX Exteriors and Enhancer\n<br />[b][size=3]-Vegetation-\n<br />[/size][/b]1. Tree mod of your choice. I like to use SFO or 3D Trees\n<br />2. Enhanced landscapes only for its grass addon\n<br />3. 3D Plants stand-alone file from 3D Trees\n<br />4. EEK's Renthal Flora Collection\n<br />[size=3][b]- Textures/Graphics-\n<br />[/b][/size]\xa0Static Mesh Improvement Mod (SMIM)\n<br />\xa0Miscellaneous Retexture Project\n<br />\xa0\x46orgotten Retex Project\n<br />\xa0\x46usa Fusa Fluffy Animals\n<br />\xa0Skyrim 2017 Textures\n<br />\xa0Windhelm HD Retexture\n<br />\xa0Whiterun Select HD\n<br />\xa0HQ College of Winterhold\n<br />Frankly HD Markarth\n<br />Rustic Cooking\n<br />\xa0High Poly Project\n<br />Ruins clutter improved\n<br />\xa0Rudy HQ - Miscellaneous SE (all optional files)\n<br />\xa0Rudy HQ - Nordic Ruins SE (all optional Files)\n<br />\xa0\x45THEREAL CLOUDS - Special Edition\n<br />[/font][font=Courier New]\xa0Skyrim Landscape Overhaul (run through Nif optimizer and save in CK) - in my opinion this mod has the absolute BEST 3D stonewalls that can be found on Nexus.\n<br />\xa0Realistic Water Two\n<br />Rustic Clothing\n<br />Rustic Standing Stones\n<br />Rustic Soulgems\n<br />Blended Roads\n<br />\n<br />So far I have provided over 148 textures.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]-Stuff In the Works-\n<br />[/size]dlc01 landscape textures\n<br />dlc02 landscape textures\n<br />[/font][s]Landscape textures[/s]\n<br />[s]Cave textures[/s]\n<br />Various Holds re-textured\n<br />[s]Dungeon textures[/s]\n<br />[s]Water textures[/s]\n<br />[s]bridge textures[/s]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]The HD Water textures are made to be used with[/b]\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2182]Realistic Water Two[/url]\xfeff[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />For the absolute best look I suggest using an ENB. As all of my screenshots are taken with one. Not a requirement in anyway, just a suggestion.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />-Questions-\n<br />\n<br />\"When are road textures happening??\" They're in the works actually. Give me some time please.\n<br />\n<br />\"What's compatible.\"\xa0\n<br />Pretty much everything.\xa0\n<br />So these are ONLY textures. No ESPs. No hassle. If you want to pick out what you want and mash it up with another mod. Go for it. Modding is what ever look/feel you're going for. Just have fun. Removing textures will not break your game, so no fear.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Feel free to add screenshots of stuff as always.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Credits to\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3086192]pannonian[/url]\xfeff\xa0\x66or the great mountain textures - he's no longer active I think but give him Kudos anyways.\n<br />This is his original mod here\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52114]Rocks4K[/url]\xfeff - I edited the textures a bit but the quality is still top notch.\n<br />\n<br />All textures are from free to use resources or created by me.[/center][center][/center]This page is still under construction"
