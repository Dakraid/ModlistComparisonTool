All Intel CPUs starting with Sandy Bridge in 2011 and AMD processors on their \"Bulldozer\" architecture and beyond offer this set of instructions.\n<br />Three versions exist: AVX, AVX2 and AVX512.\n<br />\n<br />Q: How do I know if my CPU supports AVX, and if so, which AVX?\n<br />A:\xa0[url=https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-determine-if-my-CPU-supports-AVX-instructions]https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-determine-if-my-CPU-supports-AVX-instructions[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Q: What is [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA]CUDA[/url]?\n<br />A: CUDA is a NVidia API enabling general purpose processing on the GPU. Useful when the GPU is powerful, the calculus are adapted for GPU, and the transfers between the CPU and GPU minimal.\n<br />\n<br />Q: How do I know if my GPU supports CUDA?\n<br />A: AMD GPU don't support CUDA, see [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported]here[/url] which NVidia GPU support CUDA.\n<br />\n<br />Q: is there another CPU instruction set that I should be aware of?\n<br />A: Yes, your CPU must support the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#SSE4.1]SSE 4.1 cpu instruction set[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Q: What is [url=https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3]Bullet[/url]? Do I need to install anything Bullet?\n<br />A: Bullet is a physics library enabling to do physics collision calculus, among other physics calculus. You don't need to install the Bullet library.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Does this need the previous version of HDT-SMP?\n<br />A: This is a replacer for HDT-SMP. This [u]totally replaces[/u] the previous version of HDT-SMP. If you have put specific xml code in the config files of the previous HDT-SMP, you may want to report them into the provided xml config files.\n<br />\n<br />Q: How can I have better performance?\n<br />A: Those below are suggestions, be smart about them, and report your own tips :)\n<br />a) configure the configs.xml of this mod as prefered depending on your own Skyrim and your performance,\n<br />b) use\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25240]HDT SMP XMLs[/url],\n<br />c) write your own hdt smp xml files: Here is treota's\xa0[url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/3800385-a-guide-to-hdt-smp-usersmodders/#entry34554535]Guide to HDT-SMP Users/Modders[/url],\n<br />d)\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25001]improve[/url]\xa0your HDT SMP xml files,\n<br />e)\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51229]Free FPS[/url]\xa0(shameless promotion, since I'm the author too).\n<br />\n<br />Q: What is the difference between the configs.xml file and the other HDT-SMP xml files?\n<br />A: The configs.xml file configure the functions provided by the physics engine (of the dll provided by this mod, exactly), the other xml files declare which bones, which collisions, the precise values of bouncing, collisions, etc.\n<br />\n<br />Q: HDT-SMP or CBPC?\n<br />A: I use both, and endorsed gratefully CBPC. [url=https://www.loverslab.com/topic/151663-hdt-smp-performance-question/]Here is the best discussion[/url] I found about their differences. And of course [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21224]CBPC description page[/url] is enlightening.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Can include wind?\n<br />A:\xa0If you want wind, take\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57270]Easy Wind[/url], it is HDT-SMP aers version, without performance improvements, but with wind management.\xa0\x45\x61sy Wind and this mod won't be mergeable as long as nexusid1234's source code for wind isn't available, or he merges them himself, or somebody reimplements it from the articles he wrote. Easy wind and this mod are totally incompatible, the last one loaded wins.\n<br />\n<br />Q: This mod generates bugs or CTDs, what can I do?\n<br />A: Report the bugs. You may even solve them :)\xa0The current physics-enabled clothes, capes, hair, body parts have until now been tested with\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30872]HDT-SMP[/url]\xa0\x61\x65rs version. So, if you prefer stability over performance, use it. With time, bugs in the improved code and in the physics-enabled clothes, capes, hair, body parts will be squashed.\n<br />\n<br />Q: I'd like to see the code, compile myself, add functionalities, etc.\n<br />A: see the article on compilation provided with this mod.[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]BUG REPORTS[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />When doing a bug report:\n<br />- first, check and provide\xa0\x43:&#92;Users&#92;[you}&#92;Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Skyrim Special Edition&#92;SKSE&#92;skse64.log and\xa0\x43:&#92;Users&#92;david&#92;Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Skyrim Special Edition&#92;SKSE&#92;hdtSMP64.log, or at least the relevant parts orf these logs.\n<br />- Check if another bug report already exists for your issue, and if so, add your info to it.\n<br />- Please provide in the title your version number, and the selected version in the fomod (ex: SSE - NOT CUDA - AVX2).\n<br />- Tell how to reproduce your bug, what CPU and video card you have, your fps when the bug happens, and what specific physics-enabled elements you use (clothes, hair, wig, etc.).\n<br />Thanks, folks :)[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]ETIQUETTE[/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[spoiler]So far, the response to the usefulness of this mod has been overwhelmingly positive, and I must say that I'm touched.\n<br />I really didn't think that such a response would happen.\n<br />\n<br />I'll ask users\xa0to be excellent to each others, dudes and dudettes\xa0[img]https://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/smile.gif[/img]\n<br />and I'll be a little bit more restrictive in my moderation of the comments.\n<br />First, I will hide comments when the answer is in the description, or if the question has already been answered in the comments.\n<br />Second, I will hide comments\xa0insulting others or me, even if the insult is implicit, as long as the insult isn't linked to the work provided by modders.\n<br />Third, I will block users insulting others or me, even if the insult is implicit, when the insult is linked to the work provided by modders.\n<br />Finally, I will block users disputing the DP repartition agreed with the authors (see the permissions if interested).\n<br />I will apply this moderation policy on all my mods.\n<br />\n<br />Of course, I'll be moderate, playful banter isn't insult, and I'll make sure the description is informative enough.\n<br />\n<br />sidfu is from now on blocked from my mods.\n<br />\n<br />My heartfelt thanks to everybody who sees value in this mod\xa0[img]https://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/smile.gif[/img][/spoiler][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]Details about the different versions[/size]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[size=5]Available source code\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[url=https://github.com/aers/hdtSMP64]aers branch[/url]: delivered through the HDT-SMP mod, the base, known since 12/2019, for SSE and VR\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://github.com/Karonar1/hdtSMP64/tree/gpgpu-new-reduction]Karonar1's improvements available on github[/url]\xa0(click on the link to see the detailed list of improvements), for SSE\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]dramatically improve performance,\n<br />[*]fix mass dropping in FPS when changing cells between exterior and interior,\n<br />[*]add GPU support to further increase performance,\n<br />[*]allow you to set a radius for HDT effects so that only the HDT objects within a variable limit of the character receive HDT physics.\n<br />[/list]karonar1: \n<br />1/ [b]NOT-CUDA[/b]: master branch added to aers code:\n<br />- Added distance check from PC to ActorManager - resolves massive FPS drop after certain cell transitions.\n<br />- Additional xml options for sharing and restricting mesh collisions\n<br />- Physics management extended to head parts as well as armors\n<br />\n<br />2/ [b]CUDA[/b]: gpgpu-collision branch added to master branch:\n<br />- cuda replacement of some of the algos (collision between triangles, speheres, vertices); meaning algos are computed on the GPU instead of the CPU\n<br />- reduction/simplification of transfers between cpu &amp; gpu, optimized synchronization\n<br />- bounding box checks for GPU collisions\n<br />- lots of move of algos code to GPU and subsequent improvement to these algos\n<br />\n<br />3/ [b]CUDA[/b]: gpgpu-new-reduction branch added to gpgpu-collision branch:\n<br />- improved GPU code\n<br />- still considered not enough by Karonar1\n<br />\n<br />Karonar1 improvements are used for 6 months by people taking the dlls directly on github.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://github.com/alandtse/hdtSMP64]alandtse branch[/url], for VR\n<br />- provide Karonar1 improved [b]CUDA[/b] code with aers [b]VR[/b] code, and necessary fixes\n<br />- reduces calculus to what is viewed (+/-45\xb0)\n<br />- Limit state checking to skeletons with physics\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://github.com/DaymareOn/hdtSMP64]DaydreamingDay branch, [/url]significant improvements included, for SSE and AE\n<br />\n<br />Personal conclusions, from code comments and other people tests:\n<br />- CUDA versions are interesting depending on the player configuration.\n<br />- some potential code improvement could make the CUDA code more performing for 30XX and later series, but it still need to be coded.\n<br />- the bullet library version should be 2.89. 3++ doesn't seem to provide performance improvements, so it doesn't justify the work to make it perfectly work (no auto-jiggling).\n<br />- currently, the best base to make evolutions for SE is\xa0my own branch, where most improvements have already been ported,\n<br />- currently, the only base to make evolutions to AE is my own branch,\n<br />- of course, the best bases to make evolutions to VR is the branch of alandtse.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Builds from unavailable source code[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57270]Easy wind[/url]\n<br />\n<br />HSanMartin:\n<br />no source code available yet, only a\xa0[url=https://www.mediafire.com/file/ir309o3gvuhteqo/HDT-HSANMARTIN.rar/file]build and lots of improved xmls[/url]:\n<br />- same code as Karonar1 CUDA for SSE, built for AVX,\n<br />- removed CUDA code\n<br />- added some new console commands\n<br />- fixed the RESET command (that can crash the game sometimes)\n<br />- added dynamic \"maximumDistance\" calculations that increases or decreases it based on the amount and time consumed by the Bullet calculations,\n<br />- rearranged code, to use tricks such as \"whole program optimization\"\n<br />- probably better stability, less CTDS, because of correct initialization of variables\n<br />- includes the XML with the settings that works best for him in combination with CBPC\n<br />- recommends using the configs.xml as it is, the maximum distance works as \"initial distance\" and it is dynamically recalculated at some timely intervals. The rest of the XMLs can be modified, although if you use 3BA bodies and also have CBPC, it is recommended to leave most of them as they are. Surely people would like to change the \"heaviness of breasts and butts\" (jigglyness!)... they are set to heavy as to make the effects super noticeable. Feel free to test new configs.\n<br />- runs well on Intel I5s, Intel I7s, AMD Ryzen 3700 and AMD Ryzen 3900 Pro\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]Credits &amp; thanks[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Credits and thanks to\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2025634]aers[/url],\xa0hydrogensaysHDT, Karonar1,\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/95120793]alandtse[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/70822588]hsanmartin[/url],\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/23485564]skullgirls[/url],\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/29458370]idaan300[/url], romanicles, igloomod and Sesamepaste :)\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to BullishMarket and nosferatu2007 for the info leading to this mod creation about the github fork of HDT-SMP by Karonar1 :)\n<br />Thanks to BullishMarket yet again for his comment about the performance level of the CUDA version :)\n<br />Thanks to raziell74 and SaevaVeritas for their simple explanations that I reused in the FAQ :)\n<br />Thanks to romanicles for his asking of debugging symbol files :)\n<br />Thanks to zhongjiedong and Ogrescar for their comments informing me I had forgotten to include the adequate configs.xml file :)\n<br />Thanks to the best part of the users of this mod to have convinced me not to abandon it :)\n<br />And finally, my heartful thanks to the regulars of this mod forum (right now, WodoOfSkyrim, Ogrescar, igloomod, and lots of others!)"
