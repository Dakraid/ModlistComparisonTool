nexusDescription="[color=#e06666][b]\n<br />Disclaimer: These tweaks are provided as is. If you yourself want to change/tweak anything or make a patch, feel free to do so. (see permissions!)\n<br />\n<br />I won't make any ports for consoles or Bethesda.net myself, but I do allow others to do so. (see permissions!)\n<br />[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This small mod recycles some Vanilla dialogue for hunters. It allows you to ask hunters about what they're doing and whether they have a hunting permit.\n<br />\n<br />This was inspired by the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79379]Hunting Requires Permit[/url] mod on LE.\n<br />\n<br />In addition, optionally, you can tell them that the poaching doesn't seem legal. Doing so, will make them attack, though, similar to how you would adress Skooma Dealers.\n<br />\n<br />Other than this, I would highly recommend [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1547/]Hunters Not Bandits[/url] to prevent hunters from using taunts against animals.\n<br />\n<br />This mod uses an ESLified ESP, so it doesn't count towards the 255 plugin limit."
