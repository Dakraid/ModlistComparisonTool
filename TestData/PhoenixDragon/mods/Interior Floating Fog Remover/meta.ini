nexusDescription="The [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/736/?]original mod[/url] author doesn&#39;t mod anymore and as such stated that all their mods are free to modify and publish. Moreover, someone on Skyrim modding subreddit asked for a variant of that mod. And I haven&#39;t found any alternative on the SSE Nexus.\r<br />\r<br />Go figure.\r<br />\r<br />Although it&#39;s A-OK to use meshes made for Oldrim, with specific &#34;buts&#34;, the new NIF file format is a bit more optimized. Whatever.\r<br />\r<br />So I ported the mod with ousnius&#39; [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4089/]neat tool[/url] and also (probably a questionable change, but feel free to discuss) stripped redundant editor marker and BSX flags (it is not animated and is not visible anyway, and there is no editor marker) with [url=https://github.com/jonwd7/nifskope/releases]latest version of Nifskope[/url]. This means you wouldn&#39;t be able to see the fog meshes in CK, however... I&#39;m not really sure if you actually need that.\r<br />\r<br />And there we are.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Description[/size]\r<br />[/b]\r<br />This mod replaces the floating dust meshes you very often see in dungeons with absolutely blank ones \x2014 no polygons, nothing, just the root node, header and footer. It [i]doesn&#39;t[/i] remove the distance fog \x2014 that needs an esp file with changing every cell settings, and that&#39;s what the goal of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29253/?]rgabriel15&#39;s Remove Interior Fog[/url] was.\xa0SSE port by\xa0LoD7995\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11983/?]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />It will for sure ease the navigation in your favorite draugr infested dungeon and may even give a performance boost.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Installation\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[/b]Unpack and drop in your Data folder. Overwrite if necessary.\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t forget to download and endorse the original mod made by\xa0\x37\x34\x37\x38\x32\x33 if you haven&#39;t already&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Uninstallation[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=1]but why[/size]\r<br />Remove all the installed meshes \x2014 the game will revert to originals, which are contained in Skyrim - Meshes.bsa."
