Undeath is my (one of many in Skyrim&#39;s modding history) attempt to create an immersive Lichdom mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It will have a questline that sees the player track down and stop a powerful necromancer and his followers who are seeking the lost secrets of this heretical transformation, and ensure they remain hidden... or claim them for themselves. This mod\xa0[color=#ffffff][b]will\xa0[/b][/color]require both Dawnguard AND Dragonborn.\r<br />\xa0\r<br />This was a personal project I began a while back, and I&#39;ve been working on it whenever I&#39;ve had the chance for a very long time. The ability for a character to transcend their mortality and become an immortal undead Lich is always a concept that has fascinated and excited me, but actually making this a reality in Skyrim has taken a lot of work.\r<br />\xa0\r<br />In many ways, the path to modifying Skyrim to allow the player to become a Lich has felt like the actual elusive, and arcane process of Lichdom itself. I&#39;ve researched and studied necromancy and lore for years to implement it in a sensible way, and had to learn the esoteric Black Arts of scripting, modelling and texturing to fulfill my ambitions. I&#39;ve seen many great projects filled with passion and great ideas rise and fall around this concept, with others attempting the process giving up in frustration or lack of time. But through determination, perseverance and many months of insane experiments that has driven me almost to the very brink of my sanity, I have finally achieved my goal.\r<br />[center][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0099ff][b][size=4][center]FAQ[/center][/size][/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Q: How do I start the first quest?\r<br />A: The first quest of Undeath will begin automatically when you have reached level 30 or higher.\r<br />\r<br />Q: How can I enter the Solitude Sewers?\r<br />A: The sewers have access holes in the basements of The Winking Skeever, The Bard&#39;s College and Castle Dour. You can also find entrances to the southeast and northeast of the city.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I have killed Antioch, but what do I do now?\r<br />A: Make sure that you explore and perhaps you&#39;ll come across what he was looking for&#33; The items you&#39;ve collected may come in handy as well...\r<br />\r<br />Q: I&#39;ve started &#39;The Path of Transcendence&#39;, but where do I go now?\r<br />A: Fast travel back to any of the cities in Skyrim, and keep an eye open for a message...\r<br />\r<br />Q: I can&#39;t use the Necromantic Altars?\r<br />A: The Necromantic Altars require maximum Enchanting skill in order to use.\r<br />\r<br />Q: How do I customise the final appearance of my Lich form?\r<br />A: The items you collect over the course of the questline are important and will impact your final appearance as a Lich. Make sure that you take note of their significance and choose (or create) ones which will combine for the final appearance you want. For instance: Radiant Raiment in Solitude are tailors, they probably have some dye lying around...\r<br />\r<br />Q: I keep dying during the Lich ritual&#33;\r<br />A: Make sure that you have read the Ritual Notes very carefully&#33; Becoming a Lich is a complex process, and a single missing component can spell doom for you. Make sure that you have all the items it requires, and that you&#39;re performing the ritual in the correct location. If your UI disappears during the ritual, then you&#39;ve done everything correctly.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I&#39;m performing the ritual correctly, but I keep dying still?\r<br />A: This seems to be an issue with the amount of health you have. Make sure that you have more than 100 health before beginning the ritual, as it may kill you anyway if you are too weak&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Q: I&#39;m performing the ritual correctly, but I&#39;m NOT dying?\r<br />A: Again this is an issue with the amount of health you have, or possibly your difficulty settings (as this will increase / decrease damage accordingly). Try lowering your health using the Equillibrium spell or similar before attempting the ritual again.\r<br />\r<br />Q: How do I change spells as a Lich?\r<br />A: Press the sneak button, and the spell select menu will come up after a short animation.\r<br />\r<br />Q: The spell select menu isn&#39;t coming up even after the animation...\r<br />A: This seems to vary across computers, but I think it may have something to do with a script event not registering correctly. Transforming back to human form, and then to Lich form again should solve the issue.\r<br />\r<br />Q: How do I change back to human form?\r<br />A: Press the shout / power button again whilst in Lich form to transform back. Note that there will be a short cooldown before you can transform back into Lich form, so be sure to use this carefully."
