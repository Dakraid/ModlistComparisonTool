nexusDescription="This is my first ever mod/patch that I'm uploading, so let me know if everything is good. I made this for my own gameplay, but I figured I would post it in case anyone else wanted it too.\n<br />\n<br />I really like the look of the 3D Mountain Flowers mod, but I was disappointed when it didn't work for Hearthfire planters. So I figured might as well try to make a patch, and I think it turned out alright.\n<br />\n<br />For the first patch, I added the meshes from 3D Mountain Flowers to be able to be used with the Hearthfire planters.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />For the other 2 patches, with More Growable Plants downloaded and when trying to grow the yellow mountain flower it uses the wrong model, so I went into the creation kit and changed the model. The file is an esp with an esl flag. Let me know if I did that right, it was the first time I've tried it.\n<br />\n<br />With More Growable Plants, the main version uses a different esp name than the simple version, so be sure to download the correct patch for the version of More Growable Plants that you downloaded. You only need one of the More Growable Plants patches, not both. Thanks to\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6223607]aufisch[/url]\xa0\x66or the heads up!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />You'll obviously only need the More Growable Plants - 3D Mountain Flowers patches if you use both Cathedral - 3D Mountain Flowers and More Growable Plants together. The first patch you only need the 3D Mountain Flowers.\n<br />\n<br />Also, you will need the original mods for these patches to work along with the base game and all of the dlc's.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41312]Cathedral - 3D Mountain Flowers at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community (nexusmods.com)[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3880]More Growable Plants SE at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community (nexusmods.com)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/url]Credits-\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/50222836]JonnyWang13\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4525451]numberland[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1174062]Dracula420[/url]"
