nexusDescription="Majestic Mountains conveniently alters the landscape where the entrance to Varlais Cavern is, which makes it somewhat difficult to access, and borks the Vigilants of Stendar who will stand by the entrance. This patch will fix the landscape so there's no more landscape issues.\n<br />\n<br />Install manually or with a mod manager, let it override both the affiliated mods and you should be good to go. Not my best work, but it gets the job done.\n<br />\n<br />[b]NOTE:[/b]\xa0\x41 pickaxe seen in the before image is barely under the ground. I tried to fix this numerous times but no matter what I did, it would still fall under the ground. I'm sure someone can/will fix it, but to be fair there's another pickaxe on the container, so eh.\n<br />\n<br />Mod image is placebo for the time being."
