nexusDescription="Changes the collisions for mountain meshes used in Majestic Mountains to one that matches each mountain mesh exactly. No more floating when walking across certain parts of mountains or arrows bouncing back despite not visibly hitting rock.\n<br />\n<br />This is a significantly more complex collision mesh than the one provided in Majestic Mountains. This can be a negative in terms of performance, but I haven't seen any considerable difference in my 1000+ screen archer mod list.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is an enhancement for meshes provided in Majestic Mountains, so I strongly recommend downloading the original mod as there are many meshes (and textures!) this mod does not include. This mod should overwrite those provided in Majestic Mountains.
