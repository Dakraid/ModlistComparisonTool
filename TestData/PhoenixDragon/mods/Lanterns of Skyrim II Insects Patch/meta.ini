nexusDescription="[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817]Lanterns of Skyrim II[/url] is a great mod by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6312426]WiZkiD[/url], and he's added improvements over the original. One of these improvements is a \"swarming insects\" effect around some of the lanterns, which looks great.\n<br />\n<br />For myself, I was disappointed that the effect was permanent. That is, if you have the lanterns set to turn on and off at certain times (or set to be off all the time), it does not affect the swarms. They are there whether the lanterns are on or off.\n<br />\n<br />That's where this patch comes in. It changes things so that the insects only swarm around their lantern when it is turned on. When turned off, the swarm goes away. For me, this adds a small amount of immersion to the game.\n<br />\n<br />I hope you enjoy it!\n<br />\n<br />Please Note:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817]Lanterns of Skyrim II[/url] is required for this to work. Without it,\xa0 this will probably make your game crash.\n<br />[*]If you see a lit lantern without a swarm, it doesn't mean there's a problem, it just means that lantern doesn't have a swarm effect. Not all of them do.\n<br />[*]A very few lanterns with the swarm effect are not controlled by the timer set in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817]LoS II[/url]'s MCM. They are on all the time, and so is the swarm effect.\n<br />[*]The swarm effect is best viewed in-game, not in screenshots. However, I've tried to get a few up there. For those not familiar with the swarm effect, it's the small white flecks in the air near the lantern.\n<br />[*]There are two files in the download section, each an .esp: one has been flagged as an .esl, so it won't count towards your mod limit. The other has been flagged as both an .esl and an .esm, so it won't count towards your mod limit and it won't add to the game's reference handles. (This only saves about 290 reference handles, but it might matter to someone, so now the option is there.)\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Compatibility[/b][/u]\n<br />I've tested this alongside my other LoS II mod, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50369]Lantern Caretakers of Legend[/url], and they appear to work together well. I prefer to have this mod before [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50369]Lantern Caretakers[/url] in the load order (right pane for MO2 users), but it doesn't seem to matter either way.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Special thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6312426]WiZkiD[/url] for his generous permission to share this with the Nexus community!"
