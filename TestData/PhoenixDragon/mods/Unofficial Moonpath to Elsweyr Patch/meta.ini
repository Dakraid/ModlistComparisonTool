nexusDescription="[u][size=4]Unofficial Moonpath to Elsweyr Patch[/size][/u]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4341]Moonpath to Elsweyr[/url] is a very old mod by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3232189]Muppetpuppet[/url] that's close to many people's hearts, myself included. It's been updated sporadically over the years and was ported to SE by the talented [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1240951]Illiani[/url], who maintained it for a while but now appears to have quit modding. However, a number of minor issues with it still remain unfixed, and this patch aims to address those problems.\n<br />\n<br />For a full list of changes, please see the Changelog section. In summary, the patch implements a large number of typographical fixes that slipped through the net when I made my original Moonpath to Elsweyr Typo Patch back on Oldrim, nails Mervar in his correct spot in front of the Tenmar Den entrance, properly categorises Rivercrab Meat as food, tidies up some of the NPC dialogue trees and removes several instances of \"Quill of Gemination\" - a vanilla Skyrim Quest item that was erroneously added to a couple of Moonpath's cells.\n<br />\n<br />It also prevents the quest from starting and the Khajiit from spawning until \"The Way of the Voice\" has been completed, as the NPCs in Moonpath repeatedly refer to the player as \"Dovahkiin\", which does not make sense before this point in the story. When they do spawn, they are shifted across the road from their original location to prevent conflicts with \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8379]Carriage and Ferry Travel Overhaul[/url]\". The patch has also been designed to ensure compatibility with \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802]Legacy of the Dragonborn[/url]\".\n<br />\n<br />For best results, use this patch on a save which hasn't yet been loaded with Moonpath to Elsweyr installed. Nothing game-breaking will happen if you don't use a new save - you just might have to fast travel to and from Falkreath a couple of times to get the cart to properly update to its new position.\n<br />\n<br />If you're using \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917]Beyond Skyrim - Bruma[/url]\" and would rather the Khajiit spawn in Greenwood instead of Falkreath, then my\xa0[url=https://rd.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11069]Beyond Skyrim - Bruma Moonpath to Elsweyr Synergy Patch[/url]\xa0(v2.0+) is both compatible and recommended! Just make sure the Bruma patch is sorted [b]below [/b]this patch in your load order and that its versions of \"MoonpathEnabler.pex\" and \"MoonpathEnabler.psc\" [b]replace[/b] this one's.\n<br />\n<br />Let me know if you come across any other problems, and I'll endeavour to fix them as soon as possible!\n<br />\n<br />Looking for a follower to take with you to Elsweyr?
