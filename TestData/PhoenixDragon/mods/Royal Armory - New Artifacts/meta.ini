Meanwhile in Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings every noble and their daughters seem to be carrying a sword with a name.\n<br />Wouldn\x2019t the Imperial General of Skyrim carry his own personal sword? Wouldn\x2019t the most influential Jarls of the land have a weapon that fits to their station?\n<br />If that has bothered you as much as me then this is the mod for you!\n<br />\n<br />The main goal of Royal Armory is to add immersion by giving the most important characters in Skyrim weapons to match their status.\n<br />There are no quests and no rewards in this mod. My idea was that you\x2019ll encounter these weapons naturally during play through. Some of these weapons you can obtain when the owner dies, some you may be able to steal, and some you may never get your hands on. This is first and foremost an atmospheric mod.\n<br />\n<br />But what if you are a collector and are looking for some new weapons to add to your collection?\n<br />You are not able to obtain every weapon during the game itself, but I did add an alternative way to obtain both enchanted and unenchanted versions of each weapon added by this mod. So no matter if you play this mod purely for immersion or as a collector of artifacts, you\x2019ll be able to get what you need.\n<br />\n<br />Like Heavy Armory my aim was to make new weapons that blend in seamlessly with the weapons Bethesda created.\n<br />That\x2019s why I used bits and pieces of existing weapons to create new varieties. Basically, I don\x2019t even want you to notice that there\x2019s a mod running.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][u][size=6]Installation[/size][/u][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The easiest way to install the mod is by downloading and activating through the NMM. It will do all the work for you.\n<br />If for some reason you need / want to do a manual install just download and extract the content of the .7zip to your Skyrim/Data folder (choose overwrite if asked).\n<br />All that's left to do is activate the .esp and start the game!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][u][size=6][/size][/u][/center][u][size=6]Mod Content[/size][/u]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/UZFk3Te.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Absorbs health 15 pts\n<br />- Absorbs stamina 15pts\n<br />- Paralyzes for 2 sec[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cWhile Maven Black-Briar never goes anywhere without a personal bodyguard, she\n<br /> knows that a woman of her station has to be able to defend herself as \n<br />well.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/GOBIIU6.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- 10 pts Frost Damage with 50% chance of double Frost damage\n<br />- \xa0\x33% chance of extra 45 pts Frost Damage[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201c\x43resent was forged in an age when the techniques to work Stalhrim were still \n<br />common knowledge. The axe is enchanted with the tides of winter making \n<br />it even more deadly, though somewhat unpredictable..\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/naqReQi.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Drain magicka 30 pts\n<br />- Boost own magicka 70 pts[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cShalidor created this dagger early in his life and it was meant as a defensive \n<br />weapon that takes an opponent's magical abilities and transfer it to the\n<br /> wielder. Other mages mockingly called the weapon The Hungry Knife.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/AIGdCuY.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- 15 pts Drain Stamina\n<br />- 10 pts Stamina Damage[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cThe greatsword mixes a traditional Imperial design with a sharp ebony \n<br />blade. The weapon looks alien and discomforting; a frightening sight to \n<br />any who would dare give the Commander a fight.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/vcHxizq.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Fire, Shock or Frost damage 10 pts\n<br />- Absorb magicka 15 pts[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201c\x42\x61sed on ancient Aldmerian design, these swords are the pinnacle of Altmer \n<br />craftsmanship. They are also extremely expensive to produce, reserving \n<br />them almost exclusively to the most important within the Thalmor ranks.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/2E4NyQd.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Frost damage 10 pts[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201c\x46orged by Galmar when he was still a young lad, he used this warhammer to kill\n<br /> the Frost Troll who mauled his mother to death. As trophy he mounted \n<br />the monsters head on top of the weapon.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/lR24kPH.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- 15 pts Fire damage\n<br />- 10% more damage to Elves[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cIt is said that there\x2019s always been a Gray-Mane working the Skyforge, and \n<br />that the family sword Hafyllbrand is the first weapon ever to be forged \n<br />there. Hafyllbrand displays the craftsmanship of the old Nords, and \n<br />while the sword does show its age, the steel is as sharp as any weapon \n<br />forged at the Skyforge today.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/mln1syD.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Sun damage 30 pts\n<br />- Fire damage 20 pts\n<br />- Extra damage to vampires\n<br />- Illuminates area like a torch[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cThe Hammer of Light is without a doubt one of the most powerful Dawnguard \n<br />artifacts. Legend says that the faction's founding Grandmaster managed \n<br />to trap a portion of the sun in the hammer through use of ancient \n<br />magic.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/dRo5qvO.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Absorb Stamina 10 pts\n<br />- Chaos damage 20 pts\n<br />- Boost One Handed skill by 10 pts[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cThe Harbinger's Axe was given to Harbinger Terrfyg by Hircine, the lord of \n<br />Werewolves. The axe was both a gift and an insult, for while this was a \n<br />truly powerful artifact, it was also a cruel reminder that Hircine was \n<br />now controlling Terrfyg\x2019s destiny.\x201c\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/UkaDTSB.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Fire damage 25 pts\n<br />- Adds Dragon\x2019s Command (Rally) ability[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cTullius received the sword from the emperor himself and the emperor spared no \n<br />expenses. During the Great War Judgment so much use and the sight of \n<br />this weapon held high became a beacon of hope for the Imperials on any \n<br />battlefield.\x201c[/i][/size][/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/3UGi3Cy.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Frost damage 35 pts[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cThe blade was introduced during the reign of king Wulfharth. According to \n<br />some stories Wulfharth forged the weapon himself out of stalhrim and \n<br />ebony, while others say the king found the sword stuck in a glacier. \n<br />When he pulled the weapon free, the entire glacier shattered into a \n<br />million pieces.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/S6f3sqR.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Damage stamina 15 pts\n<br />- Absorb health 15 pts\n<br />- Slow target 60 pts for 3 sec[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cNo one knows how or when Mercer Frey came into possession of the \n<br />shortsword that he calls Malice but it fits the description of a weapon \n<br />wielded by a cultist of Boethiah during the 2nd Era. This cultist was \n<br />said to be the Daedric Prince\x2019s personal assassin to whom Boethiah \n<br />granted a wicked weapon that could strike swift and drain the power from\n<br /> its victims.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/yoGoQiQ.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Shock damage 10 pts\n<br />- Grants 15% elemental resistance and 30% poison resistance[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201c\x44uring and after the Great War the Blades were systematically killed off and \n<br />many of their artifacts were destroyed. One of the few surviving \n<br />members, Esbern, took the Mentor's Blade when he went into exile as a \n<br />weapon and to safeguard this last treasure of a dieing order.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/UdgiRPg.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- 45 pts Chain Lightning[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cNeloth has always tried to push the boundaries of magic, but his research into\n<br /> heart stones has allowed him to create stronger spells than before. His\n<br /> current staff is a work of art, with and enchantment that is extremely \n<br />deadly in the right hands.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/vqt0uJk.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- No enchantment[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cThe blade was forged by Legate Rikke\x2019s father who was an exceptional \n<br />blacksmith. After his death Northern Honour was returned to young Rikke \n<br />who kept the blade by her side while she honed her skills. When it was \n<br />her time to join the legion she took the sword with her and it has not \n<br />failed her since.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/vpUQBYY.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Does extra damage to Daedra, Undead, Werewolves and Hagravens[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cPendulum is Carcette's symbol of justice, a special long mace forged years ago \n<br />specifically for her when she took office. It\x2019s a weapon made for \n<br />killing, and it\x2019s especially good at killing monsters.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/U7dnh5z.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- 10 pts Absorb Health, 15 pts shock damage (Regnving)\n<br />- 10 pts Absorb Health, 15 pts frost damage (Sn\xe6rving)[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201c To match her fighting style, Frea forged herself two hatchets; light \n<br />and small axes that allow her to slash and cut at blinding speed. The \n<br />Skaal will tell you that after Frea named her weapons the All-Maker \n<br />himself extended his blessing and enchanted the axes with the power of \n<br />storm and snow.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/j862Igc.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Frost damage 25 pts\n<br />- Extra damage against Elves[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cRikvard is a legendary axe said to have been brought to Skyrim by one of \n<br />Ysgramor's companions. Ulfric Stormcloak now wields the axe, and he \n<br />cleverly uses the mythical status of Rikvard as a symbol to solidify his\n<br /> position as leader. As his Stormcloak rebellion takes shape, Rikvard \n<br />has become a symbol of Nord independence.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/sHAxeAC.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- 20 pts absorb stamina\n<br />- 20% more damage to Falmer[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cOn one excavation Calcelmo and his nephew Aicantar uncovered a Dwarven \n<br />shortsword, which they would later name Shard. While Calcelmo was \n<br />determined to add this weapon to his Dwemer museum, Aicantar persuaded \n<br />him to keep the artifact by his side.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/PP4e47q.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- 15 pts Sun damage\n<br />- Extra damage to Undead and Werewolves[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cThe story behind Silvertongue is a cruel one. An ancient patriarch of the \n<br />Silverblood family had Silvertongue made with the silver mined in Cidhna\n<br /> mine. A swordsmith imprisoned there was forced to forge the weapon. It \n<br />is said that he labored for weeks without rest and by the time the \n<br />weapon was done, the blood from his hands ran dark over the blade.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/XgodAQO.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Chance of one or more random effects!

The task was to assassinate a \n<br />jester. Cicero returned with the dagger in hand and with his sanity \n<br />shattered. The only explanation he offered was that he made a new friend\n<br /> and they dined on cheese..\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/AImds1O.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- 15 pts Shock damage[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201c Stormbird is a beautiful little sword, extremely detailed and \n<br />displaying some of the best Altmerian craftsmanship. But it doesn't take\n<br /> a trained eye to notice the weapon's bulk; Stormbird is a heavy and \n<br />clunky weapon for it's size.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/OmIwfOB.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Stamina damage 20 pts\n<br />- Shock damage 15 pts[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cThe Blade of Dragonsreach was forged by a particular influential Jarl \n<br />during the early 2nd era as a symbol of his power. After his death the \n<br />sword was passed on from Jarl to Jarl, because in the end this \n<br />exceptional weapon is truly worthy of the leader of Whiterun.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/E5reCS5.png[/img]\n<br />[b][i]- Fire damage 15 pts\n<br />- Boost Two Handed skill by 20 pts[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][i]\x201cThe curved swords of the Alik\x2019r are a common design in Hammerfell. Yokuda\x2019s\n<br /> Edge is a remarkable weapon that takes this curved design and applies \n<br />it to a two handed sword. Kematu\x2019s sword is of truly exceptional \n<br />craftsmanship, allowing its wielder to swing at a speed that would seem \n<br />impossible for a weapon its size.\x201c[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][u][size=6]How to get these weapons?[/size][/u][/center]\n<br />\n<br />Obviously you want to get your hands on these weapons now. There are 2 ways to do this:\n<br />\n<br />1. Play the game and encounter each weapon naturally during playthrough. \n<br />This would be the immersive way. You'll encounter the weapons while playing through quests. Some you'll gte your hands on, other not.\n<br />[u]For a detailed overview of where to find all weapons, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/50977/?]see this article[/url].[/u]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />2. You want these weapons now! Or you already finished certain quests and some weapons can't be obtained anymore because the characters wielding them are dead and gone. Or you simply want unenchanted version of these weapons to put your own enchantments on.\n<br />\n<br /> Luckily for you there is another way!\n<br />Bring up your console using ` and type: \n<br />\n<br />[b]coc PITestSpace[/b]\n<br />\n<br />You'll be transported to a room with both enchanted and unenchanted copies of every weapon added by this mod.\n<br />Try them out, take them with you and use them on your quests or put them on display. The choice is yours.\n<br />(Ps. You can fast travel back to Skyrim from the test space or just use console commands to return).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][u][size=6]FAQ[/size][/u][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Always be sure to read the above mod description first! \n<br />Still didn't find the answers you're looking for? Maybe you'll find them in this section.[b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-Do Texture replacers work with HR?[/b]\n<br />[/b]Yes, as long as they override the original Skyrim textures.[b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-Does (Mod X) conflict with Royal Armory?[/b]\n<br />[/b]Royal Armory is a very minimal mod. It only adds weapons to a few characters and makes some minimal changes to a few cells.\n<br />Mods that add weapons to the same characters as this mod obviously conflict. Mods that add armor to these characters should work fine.\n<br />Also mods that heavily modify the basement of Jorrvaskr may conflict, though you should test to see if this is the case or not.[b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-Some/most weapons appear invisible.[/b]\n<br />[/b]This issue could be related to the NMM. Try re-downloading the mod. If that doesn't fix the problem, try a manual install. This has been known to fix it.[b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-Will you create a patch for (Mod X)?[/b]\n<br />[/b]No. But if anybody would like to create a patch between HA and another mod they are free to do so. Upload your mod and send me a link so I can link to it in the description.[b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]-Can I translate Royal Armory to another language?[/b]\n<br />[/b]I\x2019\x64 be happy if you did! Upload your translation and send me a link so I can link to it in the description.[b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />-Can I use assets from your mod for my own mod project?[/b]\n<br />Sure! But I\x2019\x64 ask you to notify me either through a PM or in the comment section. Also I want to be credited in your mod for the work you use.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6308?tab=description][img]https://i.imgur.com/mn4KX6c.jpg[/img][/url]\xfeff[/center]\n<br />[line]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69438][img]https://i.imgur.com/kYXJP9h.jpeg[/img][/url] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72728][img]https://i.imgur.com/MwpmtUn.jpeg[/img][/url]\n<br />[line]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14168][img]https://i.imgur.com/m4bvxFG.jpg[/img] [/url]\xfeff[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22513][img]https://i.imgur.com/Ynv52CG.jpg[/img]  [/url]\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][u][size=6]Thank you[/size][/u][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Thank you!
