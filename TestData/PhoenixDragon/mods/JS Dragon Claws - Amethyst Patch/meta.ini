nexusDescription="[b]Description Amethyst Patch:[/b]\n<br />As with many of you fellow skyrim modders, I use johnskyrim's beautiful JS Dragon Claws to add that little extra bit of spice to my game. His meshes and textures are truly a work of art, and dare I say - a requirement if you want that \"ZOMG 2018 Ultra Realistic Skyrim 400+ Mod Setup\". So, imagine my frustration when I found out that contrary to all known prophecies, the mod does not cover the Dragonborn dlc amethyst claws!\n<br />\n<br />- Oh my god!\n<br />- Oh no!\n<br />- By the nines!\n<br />\n<br />Shhh! Do not despair children - for one day a patch will be made. It must be so...\n<br />And this is that day, where a patch has been made and the package is complete! Praise Talos! (or don't if you support the Thalmors).\n<br />\n<br />Now... with that being said, [b]what have I done?[/b]\n<br />- I've split johnskyrim's claw mesh into two separate\xa0pieces\n<br />- I redid the collision on these pieces and matched the shaders to johnskyrim's other claws\n<br />- I made sure to edit the door meshes to use the new claws\n<br />\n<br />Finally, I made sure to include a mod that automatically makes you 1% more happier - happy Skyrim!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Description Helgen Reborn Patch:[/b]\n<br />This patch obviously requires Helgen Reborn. Recolors the claw and gives it the JS Dragon Claw overhaul.\n<br />The .esp is tagged as an .esl to avoid taking up an .esp slot.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Description Wyrmstooth Patch:[/b]\n<br />This patch replaces the rusted claw with a claw more true to the JS Dragon Claw overhaul.\n<br />The .esp is tagged as an .esl to avoid taking up an .esp slot.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Description Konahrik's Accoutrements Patch:[/b]\n<br />Patches the bronze claw mesh. No .esp required.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Instructions:[/b]\n<br />Just install as normal with NMM/Vortex/MO and let the mod overwrite any mod that alters the dragon claws."
