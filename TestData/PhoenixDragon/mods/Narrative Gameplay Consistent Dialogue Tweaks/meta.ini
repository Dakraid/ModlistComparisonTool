nexusDescription="[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Description[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Certain dialogue by NPCs in Vanilla wasn't consistent with actual gameplay.\n<br />\n<br />The following cases were adressed:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ingun_Black-Briar]Ingun Black-Briar[/url]: She mentions that Nirnroot does not grow back, while in fact, it does. I removed her mentioning it: [i]\"Nirnroot is the easiest. It grows only by the water and makes a unique chiming noise. [color=#e06666][s]The only drawback is it won't regrow after harvesting.[/s][/color]\"[/i]\n<br />[*] [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Wuunferth_the_Unliving]Wuunferth the Unliving[/url]: \n<br />[/list][list=1]\n<br />[*]He mentions being part of the College of Winterhold and that they do not allow necromancy, while several NPCs in the College contradict this:\xa0[i]Necromancy? [color=#e06666][s]I am a member of the [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:College_of_Winterhold_(faction)]College of Winterhold[/url], in good standing![/s][/color]\xa0 [color=#93c47d]Come now.[/color] [color=#e06666][s]They\xa0[/s][/color] [color=#93c47d]We [/color]haven't allowed necromancy for hundreds of years!\"[/i] \n<br />\n<br />[*]He also says that the necromancers amulet once depicted a skull, while in fact, it still does: [i]I know it well. Or at least, I've heard of it. I would wager that carving [color=#e06666][s]once [/s][/color]depicted a skull. That is the [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Necromancer%27s_Amulet]Necromancer's Amulet[/url], of legend. It appears you were at least half-right. There is necromancy at the heart of this.\"[/i]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*] [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Svana_Far-Shield]Svana[/url] and [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Haelga]Haelga[/url]: If you start the quest [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Caught_Red_Handed]Caught Red Handed[/url], Svana will talk bad about Haelga, but in Vanilla there are no checks to see Haelga is near. It felt very jarring to me, that Svana talks bad about her while standing next to her. As such, I added a condition for Haelga to be outside the [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Haelga%27s_Bunkhouse]bunkhouse[/url], for the dialogue to trigger on Svana.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*] Same as Svana and Haelga, I applied the same logic to [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sven]Sven[/url] and [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Faendal]Faendal[/url] in Riverwood, so they'll need to standing a certain from each other for the dialogue to trigger.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hadvar]Hadvar [/url]\xfeff\x61nd [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ralof]Ralof [/url]\xfeff\x62oth mention: \"It's probably best if we split up.\" Looking at what they say later, this line didn't make much sense, so I disabled the line.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]FAQ[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Q: ESPFE?\n<br />A: Yes.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is this compatible on a existing save?\n<br />A: It should work yes.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you make a patch for X?\n<br />A: Maybe eventually, but not right now.\n<br />\n<br />Q: What's the point of this?\n<br />A: \"Fer uhmershun!\" In all seriousness, I made this mod as a request. If it's not your cup of tea, that's okay. This mod isn't for everyone. Just move along silently.\n<br />\n<br />Q: \"Isn't this part of the unreliable narrator?\"\n<br />A: \"There's part for that in certain parts of the game, however, in my opinion, the cases adressed in this mod do not feel under this, since the NPCs should know these things.\"\n<br />\n<br />Q: \"Isn't Nirnroot supposed the not grow back? It was like that in Oblivion.\"\n<br />A: \"I found it easier to fix it the other way around. If you feel inclined to actually make it not grow back, feel free to do so.\"\n<br />\n<br />Q: \"There's already a mod that's adressing that dialogue from Wuunferth, namely [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56378?]this mod[/url]. What's the difference between that one and yours? Will you make a patch?\"\n<br />A: Yes, I am aware of that mod and I consider it a great alternative to mine. The difference is that that one uses synthed dialogue and mine uses spliced dialogue. I have no plans to make a patch.\"\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you port this to &lt;insert other version of Skyrim&gt;?\n<br />A: I only support the [color=#93c47d][b]PC Steam English Special Edition of Skyrim.[/b][/color] Any other version I won't support myself. However, I do allow others to\n<br /> port it to other version at their own responsibility. (see permissions)\n<br />\n<br />Q: I have this cool idea. &lt;insert idea&gt; Will you add this?\n<br />A: Maybe. If I like it and doesn't take too much time/effort.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Does this work with AE?\n<br />A: Maybe, I don't know. I myself use the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57618?]\"best of both worlds version of the downgrade patcher\"[/url]."
