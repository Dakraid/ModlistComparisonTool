nexusDescription="[center][/center][size=5][center]SEXIER VANILLA - GUARDS[/center][/size]\n<br />[left]\n<br />[size=3]Want town guards and Stormcloaks to have diverse and [i][font=Comic Sans MS]immersive[/font][/i] gear while maintaining the vanilla aesthetic? Look no further.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Features\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]A vanilla-style, lightweight overhaul; made with vanilla and vanilla+ modlists in mind.[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Guards will have a 50/50 chance of spawning in with new heavy armor. Heavy sets will use a new heavy armor and vanilla heavy boots, gauntlets, shield, and helmet depending on city.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Light armor is the regular vanilla set.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Stormcloaks will use a variety of mismatched gear. Light use anywhere from fur to leather, heavy use iron through steel with some ancient nord mixed in. Stormcloaks will now actually look like rebels using whatever they can get their hands on. The appearance of any given Son of Skyrim will now range from anywhere between milk drinker who left their family farm to fight in the war to Hans Fuck-Beard, the greatest hero who ever lived.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Stormcloak Officers now have a heavy variant. Galmar will still wear the vanilla version.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]All sets are distributed via leveled lists and outfits.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]All new armor pieces can be improved at the workbench.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Customizable. Don't like one of my changes or want to make one of your own? Everything is structured in a way where you can easily add your own armors into either the light or heavy pools. Take a look for yourself, it's hard to explain in writing just trust me dude really it's easy.[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />Compatibility:\n<br />Only vanilla leveled lists and outfits are changed, except one npc record (Stormcloak officers who spawn in civil war battles.) Most of my additions take place in new records. This mod is compatible with all NPC replacers (for now, may change in the future), mods that touch the armor and armor addon records for vanilla armors, and all retextures. If you are unsure if this mod is compatible with another, load it up in xedit and take a look. This is meant to be used in place of other guard overhauls, like Guards Armor Replacer. Other guard overhauls are assumed incompatible, and I probably won't make patches for them (unless they look vanilla and I feel like adding it in, but don't count on it). Make sure it's loaded after anything else that touches the same records and you should be fine.\n<br />[/size][size=3][/size]\n<br />[size=3][size=3]Patches are provided for:\n<br />[/size][/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]WACCF[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Armor Variants Extension[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Immersive Sounds Compendium[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Cloaks of Skyrim[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Winter is Coming[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />To do:\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]The default cbbe vanilla Stormcloak mesh is wacky, and reads the texture differently than vanilla (I think). Some retextures will have a weird, elbow-guard looking glitch on them. Not the end of the world, I plan to make a bodyslide that doesn't do that some time in the future. Either don't generate bodyslide for those meshes or live with the glitch.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Make a new heavy Riften set that doesn't use Thieves Guild assets. Maybe a mashup with Steel Plate? Don't know yet.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Maybe another light and heavy variants for stormcloaks? Only if I can think of a cool design, don't hold your breath.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Fix any bugs or screw-ups I missed, if any. Apologies in advance if there are any and thank you in advance for letting me know about them if there are any.[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Heavy armor meshes from [/size][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24115]Varied Guard Armor by QwibQwibMods[/url]\xfeff, who has allowed the meshes to be used with credit. \n<br />Fomod made using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6821/?tab=description]FOMOD CREATION TOOL by Wenderer[color=#ffffff].[/color]\n<br />[/url]\xfeff\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/left]"
