I hope your children would like this.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Main file\r<br />[/b][/u][/size]The replacement of the hearthfire doll and the load screen model (girl with a doll).Choose one face type, one body type(human race or beast race) and one dress color. The doll of the load screen always has the default face and the dress with your installed color.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=4]About the optional plugin\r<br />[/size][/u][/b]This file adds all race types dolls (choose one face type at installing them) and a strange doll in Calixto&#39;s house in Windhelm.\r<br />These dolls except a strange doll are just decorative objects of Miscellaneous category in a inventory and will be sold randomly at some of general goods shops in Skyrim (vampire dolls and werewolf dolls are rarely sold).
