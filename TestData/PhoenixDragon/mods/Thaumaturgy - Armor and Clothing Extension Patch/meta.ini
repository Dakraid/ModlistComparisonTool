nexusDescription="All the patches are esl-flagged esps and will not take up a plugin slot in your load order.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]*NEW* [u][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35390]AmidianBorn Content Addon[/url]:\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/b]Made for us by the fabulous [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/119110]Oxide[/url]!\n<br />\n<br />Patches the vanilla enchanted armor records to carry over changes by both the Content Addon and Thaumaturgy.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Note[/b]: enchanted helmets will not take your circlet slot, only hair, by author's preference.\n<br />\n<br />Load order: Should be fine regardless of whether the Content Addon or Thaumaturgy is loaded first.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19002]Armor and Clothing Extension[/url]:[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Forwards changes made by ACE and brings the added clothing in line with Thaumaturgy's pricing and enchanting edits.\n<br />\n<br />Requires the WACCF patch for Thaumaturgy found on the main page.  Load order should be:\n<br />\n<br />Weapons Armor Clothing &amp; Clutter Fixes.esp\n<br />WACCF_Armor and Clothing Extension.esp\n<br />Thaumaturgy.esp\n<br />Thaumaturgy \x2013 WACCF Patch.esp\n<br />Thaumaturgy \x2013 ACE Patch.esp\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5336]Immersive Jewelry[/url]:[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Soft requirement: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51255?tab=description]Immersive Jewelry\x2013 Lower Value[/url][/b] (either the replacer or patch version).  I used the prices in this edit as a base, to avoid unbalancing Thaumaturgy as well as potential other Simonrim mods.  You don't have to use it, but there will be a huge discrepancy between the prices in jewelry if you don't.  I WILL NOT be making a version with the original Immersive Jewelry prices, so please don't ask.\n<br />\n<br />Merges the pricing, mesh, enchantment, and naming changes made to the vanilla enchanted jewelry by Immersive Jewelry and Thaumaturgy, and brings Immersive Jewelry's added enchanted jewelry in line with Thaumaturgy's enchanting and naming edits.  (Eg., swapping rings from left to right should leave you with the same name and enchantment.)  Also patches two leveled lists and edits the enchanting FormID lists in accordance with the changes made by Thaumaturgy.  (If you can't use the enchantment on necklaces, you can't use it on torcs, high necklaces, or chokers either, etc.)\n<br />\n<br />Load order should be:\n<br />\n<br />Immmersive Jewelry.esp\n<br />(optional) Immersive Jewelry \x2013 Lower value.esp\n<br />Thaumaturgy.esp\n<br />Thaumaturgy \x2013 IJ Patch.esp\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3058]Morrowloot Ultimate[/url]:[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Patches armor and weapon records as well as some leveled lists, and brings Thaumaturgy's added enchanted armors and weapons in line with MLU's stats.\xa0 Made without artifacts, so the special dwarven weapons (Pneuma-trap, Stormforge, etc.) are just normal dwarven weapons.  \n<br />\n<br />Load order: Made with MLU loading AFTER Thaumaturgy, but theoretically it should work either way.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Notes:[/b] These were made for my personal playthrough, and as such I probably won't be making any more unless or until my own setup requires them.\xa0 These were somewhat tricky and/or extensive patches to create, though, so I thought I'd share them with others.  I hope you enjoy!"
