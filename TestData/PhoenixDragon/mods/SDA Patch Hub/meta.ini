Why else would you be here?\xa0\n<br />\n<br />SDA was designed with compatibility in mind, but it still has quite a doozy of content. This \"patch hub\" aims to fix that by providing an all-in-one automatic 'FOMOD' installer and mod page for everything SDA patch-related, while keeping the main SDA one as squeaky clean as a vanilla install.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />As of the 1.0 release, the patches provided here are identical to those available on the main SDA Nexus page.\n<br />\n<br />[center][/center]\n<br />[u][size=4]Available Patches\n<br />[/size][/u][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]Add-On/Framework Patches:\n<br />[/size][/color]OpenSex (Flower Girls, OStim, SexLab support already built into the mod)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f9cb9c][size=3]Awareness Patches (Gameplay Mods):\n<br />[/size][/color]Campfire- When Serana is in a relationship with the player, she can spoon with them at a Campfire. Requires the Campfire mod by Chesko.\n<br />Wintersun-\xa0Optional patch for the Wintersun mod, so that it recognizes SDA's custom Serana marriage for Mara, Dibella, and Morwha's religious tenets.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f9cb9c][size=3]Awareness Patches (Armor Mods):[/size][/color]\n<br />Crimson Blood Armor-\xa0\x44ialogue awareness for the DX Crimson Blood Armor. To start, during the Chasing Echoes quest, read Valerica's Journal placed in the Castle Courtyard.\xa0\n<br />Lustmord Armor-\xa0Optional patch for the Lustmord Armor. New quest-aware commentary, as well as dialogue for said armor.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f9cb9c][size=3]Compatibility Patches:\xa0[/size][/color]\n<br />Amorous Adventures-\xa0Recommended patch for those who use Amorous Adventures (Not AA Plus). Rebuilt from the ground-up so that it just disables all the Amorous Adventures Serana content on game load.\n<br />Castle Vokihar Rebuilt-\xa0Patch for the Castle Volkihar Rebuilt mod, ensuring that SDA's Home Marker works well with this mod (which also changes Serana's dismiss point).\n<br />Nether's Follower Framework-\xa0\x44ialogue line patch for Nether's Follower Framework to reduce VA overlap and solve quest compatibility issues.\n<br />NPCs Wear Amulets of Mara-\xa0Patch for NPCs Wear Amulets of Mara, carrying over marriage records from SDA to the new dialogues in the former mod. Patch by Mur4s4me.\xa0\n<br />Relationship Dialogue Overhaul-\xa0This patch disables RDOs added dialogue to prevent VA overlap and provide a consistent user experience.\xa0\n<br />[s]Serana Dialogue Edit-\xa0\x44ialogue line patch for Serana Dialogue Edit to reduce VA overlap and solve compatibility issues.\xa0[/s](SDE is not supported anymore).\n<br />Convenient Horses-\xa0Patch for the Convenient Horses mod to ensure you can use Serana's Custom Horse Support from SDA along with the new features/horse support that naturally comes with the former mod.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f9cb9c][size=3]Feature Preference Patches:[/size][/color]\n<br />Clothed Sleep Patch- Patch to have Serana not unequip her armor when sleeping. This is just a modified script; if you're using this patch- make sure it overwrites SDA's.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u]SDA Integrations[/u] (Integrated Into the Mod, No Patches Needed)\n<br />[/size][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]Animation Frameworks:\n<br />[/size][/color]Flower Girls, OStim, SexLab\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f9cb9c][size=3]Awareness Patches (Gameplay Mods):\n<br />[/size][/color]Sleep Tight\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f9cb9c][size=3]Awareness Patches (Armor Mods):\n<br />[/size][/color]BDO Ram Horn Witch (as of Version 3.1, yet to be released)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f9cb9c][size=3]Follower Banter:\xa0\n<br />[/size][/color]Inigo, Auri, Sofia\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][size=4]Mod Requirements[/size]\n<br />[/u][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32161]Serana Dialogue Add-On[/url] (The latest available version)\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u]Install Instructions\n<br />[/u][/size][size=3]Just install how you normally would with your mod manager of choice.
