But it lacked illumination outdoors and with darker nights it was hard to play it at night.\n<br />So I decided to make a full addon that brings the lanterns of LOS II to Wyrmstooth like I did to Falskaar. It includes a full lantern system for all roads and lighting in all locations with map markers. All settlements, map locations, and some points of interest got new lights. Added lights to campfires, melters, and fire pits.\n<br />\n<br />I won't remove lights if there is no bug like flickering or clipping. But I could add lights where I forgot it. And you can report interior light flickering, or wrong object placements.\n<br />\n<br />I'm using a light Reshade and Darker Nights for Vivid Weathers in my screenshots and videos. Interior screenshots use my addon for interiors.\n<br />\n<br />If you don't like the color or strength(fade) of lights with the prefix LOS_LIGHT_, you can adjust it yourself. I didn't change this value in the references. Can be installed or uninstalled at any time.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e69138][b]----------------------------------------------\n<br />Main Features\n<br />----------------------------------------------[/b][/color]\n<br />All towbs and settlements have lights.\n<br />Every major road has street lights.\n<br />Some minor roads have light sources like cave lamps and draugr fire pits.\n<br />Lights added to campfires, melting and smithing stations.\n<br />Lights added to cave entrances, some received glowing mushrooms as light source.\n<br />Some blueish effect lights added for statues and some waterfalls.\n<br />Fixed light flickering in some interior cells.\n<br />Fixed\xa0 object placement in some cells.\n<br />Dimmed some too bright lights in Dwemer buildings.\n<br />Added lighting templates to room markers for mushroom lights.\n<br />Added some mist effects to water.\n<br />Increased follow radius of follwers, they were way too close.\n<br />Moved Falmers away from the Dimfrost Boilery door, they killed you before you could move.\n<br />Spiddal Stick harvest improved, it's a leveled list now with chances for 1, 2 or 3.\n<br />Bridge near Fort Valus: Added a snow textureset and better material to the bridge to be compatible with real blended roads.\n<br />Placed two dead lantern workers as decoration.\n<br />Contains no quest, no new script and no navmesh changes.\n<br />Mod doesn't need cleaning. Every changed record from Wyrmstooth has a purpose.\n<br />File is an ESP flagged as ESL. You can find an optional file in ESP format in the data_optional folder.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e69138][b]----------------------------------------------\n<br />Interior Lighting Addon\n<br />----------------------------------------------[/b][/color]\n<br />Take it or leave it, it's a copy of my personal lighting mod for Skyrim as an ESL flagged esp. It makes ice frostier, inns warmer, dark places darker, and caves and ruins more epic. Gives every interior cell more contrast. No lights changed, just added imagespaces and lighting templates to all interior cells.\n<br />May or may not combine with your personal ENB or mod that changes lights. \n<br />Can be uninstalled at any time. Only requirement is Wyrmstooth.esp, needs to be installed after all Wyrmstooth addons and my main mod.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e69138][b]----------------------------------------------\n<br />Known issues\n<br />----------------------------------------------[/b][/color]\n<br />The lanterns aren't linked to the night cicle of Lanterns of Skyrim. If you think it's an issue tell me.\n<br />I did everything to not add new flickering but some may occure in rare cases, especially if you and your followers use torches or magic lights.\n<br />I didn't change any navmesh. I tried to place new objects outside pathes but it may occure in rare cases that some NPC crash with new objects.\n<br />Sometimes I could see a lantern on the ground. Should normally be gone after the next start of the game.\n<br />[color=#e69138]\n<br />[b]----------------------------------------------\n<br />Requirements\n<br />----------------------------------------------[/b][/color]\n<br />Wyrmstooth\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565\n<br />Lanterns Of Skyrim II\xa0\xa0 \xa0https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e69138][b]----------------------------------------------\n<br />Installation\n<br />----------------------------------------------[/b][/color]\n<br />The main file is an ESP with an ESL flag. \n<br />The file Lanterns Of Wyrmstooth.esp found in the folder data_optional is in ESP format if you have any problem.\n<br />Copy the contents of this data folder to your data folder.
