Could do with a remake but oh well I've already remade this twice\n<br />\n<br />[center][youtube]fbj32TMn5Q8[/youtube]\xfeff[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[line][color=#c9daf8][u][b][size=6][center]Features[/center][/size][/b][/u][/color][center][b][size=4]You can Jump and attack with all melee weapons by simply pressing your regular attack buttons[/size][/b][b][size=4][/size][/b][/center][b][size=4]\n<br />[u][center][color=#ffd966]Be sure you sheath and unsheathe your Weapons or Hands after installing/updating the mod \n<br />Not sure why I'm putting this here as no one will read this[/color][/center][/u][/size][/b]\n<br />All weapon types are supported as well as magic and bows/crossbows\n<br />New Jumping Animations for when you have a weapon out\n<br />Slightly tweaked animation code for jumping with a weapon drawn\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Regular Attacks allow you to move freely in the air   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Power Attacks restrict your movement until you land\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/hQrvFT6.gif[/img]\xfeff    \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/UroTtgN.gif[/img]\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center]First Person is also lightly supported \n<br />\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/2lJAIJo.gif[/img][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[line][color=#cfe2f3][size=6][b][u][center]Compatibility[/center][/u][/b][/size][/color][center][b][size=4]AE Is compatible, behaviour mods don't need separate versions for each game versions[/size][/b][/center]\n<br />I've tried making this as compatible as possible, there's a lot of patches in the fomod that you can toggle on or off when installing\n<br />Some versions of both [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31390]SkySa[/url] and ABR,\xa0\x41\x44XP/MCO, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65579]Elden Counter[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53256]Paragliding[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36889]Jump Behaviour overhaul[/url], Project impact, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54056]SkySA Grip Switch[/url] all have patches in the fomod\n<br />\n<br />There's support for an upcoming mod that will give you a small damage multiplier(1.2x) on Jumping power attacks\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614]True Directional Movement[/url] Has no issues with this mod\xa0 what so ever\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18967]Better Jumping[/url] Works with this, there is a weird issue though when doing a sprint jump attack with the sprint attack perk unlocked, the attack will go through but there's a tiny movement slow down\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56236]Double jumping animation[/url] mods work but only with a weapon sheathed \n<br />Any animation replacers for your jumping will only work with weapons sheathed \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33767]Base/full CGO[/url] and any CBE version - ARE NOT COMPATIBLE\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43436]ZxLice BackStab and Parry[/url] is not compatible, I have no idea why it's the strangest incompatibly I've seen\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60878]One Click Power Attack[/url] is not compatible, it has a feature that prevents you from doing the power attacks mid air\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45193]Separate power attacks[/url] - Can work with this, but you need to load it after Jump attack's esl\n<br />\n<br />[line][color=#cfe2f3][size=6][center][b][u]For Modders[/u][/b][/center][/size][/color]Behaviour source and Animations sources are in the optional files\n<br />\n<br />I've added some \"hooks\" to the jumping attacks so people can do some stuff with them\n<br />When a regular mid air attack starts an event called \"[i]JumpAttackFloat[/i]\" is fired - [size=1]This is more for SKSE authors as I don't think you can listen for custom animation events via papyrus[/size]\n<br />When doing any Melee Jump Attack a Boolean variable called \"[i]bIsJumpAttack[/i]\" is toggled on - [size=1]You can use this in conditions and stuff[/size]\n<br />There's a Float Variable that is used to determine if you're in the air or landed called \"[i]InAir[/i]\" 1 = In air, 0 = Grounded - [size=1]You can use this in conditions and stuff\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Give me a shout if you require different hooks, I may be able to add some more stuff in if need be[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/size]If you wanted to make new Power attack animations, they're set up in a way that may seem confusing at first(it's one animation split into 3 via behaviours)\n<br />The Animations are set up as the following: [color=#ffe599]Total of 65 frames 0 - 65 : lasts for [color=#ffe599]2.16667[/color] seconds[/color]\n<br /> Windup and Swing : [color=#ffe599]Frame 0 to 11 : time 0 to 0.366667[/color]\n<br />Falling Loop : [color=#ffe599]Frame 11 to 25 : time [color=#ffe599]0.366667[/color] to 0.866667[/color]\n<br />Land and exit : [color=#ffe599]Frame 26 to 65 : time 0.866667 to 2.16667[color=#ffffff] - [b]Behaviours speed playback up to 1.5[/b]\n<br />All times are the same between weapon types due to gravity\n<br />\n<br />YOU DON'T NEED ANNOTATIONS/ANIMATION EVENTS IN A POWER ATTACK\n<br />[/color][/color]\n<br />You need to keep all the Power Attack timings the same else your animation will not look right in game, it's a shame I did it this way but considering I \n<br />can't control gravity in a decent way or fake gravity etc this will have to do \n<br />\n<br />Regular attacks consist of 10 animations, the mid air attack, the landing while standing and then 4 cardinal directions while running and walking\n<br />Annotations are needed for regular attacks,\n<br />The [color=#dd7e6b][b]mid air attack[/b][/color] animations need the \"[color=#dd7e6b]preHitFrame[/color]\" \"[color=#dd7e6b]weaponSwing[/color]\" and \"[color=#dd7e6b]HitFrame[/color]\" annotations/events\n<br />All the [color=#a4c2f4][b]landing animations[/b][/color] need \"[color=#a4c2f4]AttackWinStart[/color]\" and \"[color=#a4c2f4]AttackWinEnd[/color]\" annotations/events, they don't need the other three and even then, these two are only if you want to be able to combo out of the landing attack\n<br />\n<br />Animation length don't matter to much for the regular attacks, the shorter the better though so you can get your swing mid air\n<br />1hm I use a 34 frame animation : lasts for 1.13333 seconds\n<br />2hm I use a 45 frame animation : lasts for 1.5 seconds\n<br />[b]\n<br />All the regular attack animations for a weapon type need to be the same length as each other\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Regular Attacks and Power Attacks support [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65089]Payload Interpreter[/url] when they land, they both send different payloads there's an included ini in the core files of Jumping attack that has the events in they currently spawn empty nif particle effects\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]$1hmPwrAtkLand[/color] and [color=#c27ba0]$2hmPwrAtkLand[/color] are the payload instruction names\n<br />\n<br />[line][b][u][color=#c9daf8][size=6][center]Thanks and Credits[/center]\n<br />[/size][/color][/u][/b]My Patrons -
