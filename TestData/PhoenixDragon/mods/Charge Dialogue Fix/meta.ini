nexusDescription="This mod is a simple edit that adds \"not in combat/critical\" conditions to the dialogue that normally plays when you run into people. So people will still get mad at you for running into them around town, but won\x2019t utter ridiculous last words when you smack them with your sword.\n<br />\n<br />Thought I might as well put it up on SE"
