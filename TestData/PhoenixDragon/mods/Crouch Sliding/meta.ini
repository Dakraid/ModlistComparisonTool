nexusDescription="[center][color=#c9daf8][size=6]Crouch Sliding \n<br />[/size][/color]A behaviour mod that allows you to crouch slide and slide tackle people\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]oDPUEvuX3II[/youtube][youtube]4aqs-AmE_Gc[/youtube]\n<br />Video by [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbS9VGfMUd5_ot_lZaQMWyg]JDM[/url]\xfeff[/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Adds in a crouch slide, when you're sprinting press your sneak key to perform a crouch slide, this gives you i-frames and(optionally) will cause surrounding NPC's to ragdoll away from you\n<br />You can toggle the ragdolling on and off via a spell that is added to your character automatically, as I can understand why people wouldn't want that\n<br />\n<br />It works in first person, although first person is a bit iffy, sometimes the animations don't play, sometimes you get double slide audio, and with certain combos of items you get a slight boost, I'm not looking to fix these issues as they're not game breaking or cause any major issue, the first person behaviour files are complete bonkers\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#cfe2f3][size=6]Installing/Uninstalling[/size][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#d9d2e9][b][u]Steps for Installing[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />1) Download and install [url=https://github.com/ShikyoKira/Project-New-Reign---Nemesis-Main/releases]Nemesis[/url](Off Site Link)\n<br />2) Download and install this mod\n<br />3) Run Nemesis and tick \"[b][color=#ffd966]Crouch Sliding[/color][/b]\" in the list of patches\n<br />4) With your patches selected, click [b]\"[color=#ffd966]Update Engine[/color]\"[/b] wait for that to finish then click on [b]\"[color=#ffd966]Launch Nemesis Behavior Engine[/color]\"[/b] wait for that to finish\n<br />\n<br />[color=#d9d2e9][b][u]Steps for Uninstalling[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />1) Save the close the game \n<br />2) Uninstall in your preferred mod manager\n<br />3) Run Nemesis and click [b]\"[color=#ffd966]Update Engine[/color]\"[/b] wait for that to finish then click on [b]\"[color=#ffd966]Launch Nemesis Behavior Engine[/color]\"[/b] wait for that to finish\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#cfe2f3][size=6]Compatibility\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/104043/104043-1596895468-1467965868.gif[/img][/center]\n<br />Like all modern behaviour mods, it's [b]not[/b] compatible with FNIS\n<br />\n<br />Enbs can make the slide dust brightly coloured/cartoony, I've made a version of the FX that is a bit toned down\n<br />\n<br />This doesn't replace the vanilla sneak roll, it works alongside it\n<br />\n<br />DAR [b]is[/b] compatible [b]but[/b] due to DAR's caching system, you wont be able to crouch slide after loading a save for a few seconds, nothing I can do about that \xaf&#92;_(\x30c4)_/\xaf\n<br />\n<br />SkySA, 360 Behaviour, Jump Behaviour overhaul, Movement Behaviour overhaul, Ultimate combat are all compatible out the box just make sure the SprintSlide.esp(this mod) is below the other mods esp\n<br />\n<br />The Ultimate Dodge mod, I've included a patch in the optional files download, just make sure the SprintSlideUltDodge.esp(the compatibility patch) is below The Ultimate Dodge mod's esp\n<br />\n<br />CGO, while nothing game breaking happens this mod is not compatible with the Sneak key dodge roll in CGO for obvious reasons, it's compatible with the hotkey dodge though"
