Download here: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61087/]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61087/[/url][b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />INTRODUCTION[/b]\n<br />Darkest Dungeon has once again inspired me to make a mod for Skyrim, this time based off the \"Stygian/Bloodmoon\" difficulty which gives you a set number of in-game weeks to beat the game by, otherwise it's game over. This mod essentially mimics that feature. Alduin is the world eater, and the only person who can stop him is the Dragonborn. If DB is just lounging around all day doing Skooma and crafting iron daggers, you can bet this giant dragon isn't just going to wait patiently for you to learn how to defeat him!\n<br />\n<br />[b]OVERVIEW[/b]\n<br />This mod adds a customizable timer to your game that counts days, and indicates when Alduin will stage his attack against literally the entire universe. The timer starts as soon as the mod is installed (or as soon as you start the game if it's a fresh save), and if you don't defeat Alduin before you reach doomsday, you'll be treated to hellfire raining down from the sky caused by a mega-Alduin soaring overhead, followed by death. Then you'll have to reload an earlier save and try to do it faster or start a new game entirely. That's it really :P\n<br />\n<br />[b]MCM SUPPORT[/b](SKSE only)[b]\n<br />[/b]This mod includes an MCM (Mod Configuration Menu) that you can use to customize this mod's features. Here, among other things, is where you can configure\xa0 how many days you want your time limit to be set to. You can also \"lock in\" your time limit setting here so that you don't get tempted to move the goalpost if you get close to the expiration date.\n<br />\n<br />[b]REQUIREMENTS[/b]\n<br />Just Skyrim for basic functionality, but SKSE (Skyrim Script Extender) is strongly recommended as you won't be able to easily customize the mod without it. Also, the only way to view your countdown timer without SKSE is the \"Doomsday Clock\" Spell.\n<br />\n<br />If you don't have SKSE and don't wish to install it, you can adjust your countdown timer by opening the command console and typing [b][color=#b6d7a8]set GameDaysLeft to X[/color][/b] with X being the desired amount of days from the start of the game til doomsday.\n<br />\n<br />A fresh save is recommended but not required; this mod will disable itself if it detects that the main quest has been completed. \n<br />\n<br />If you already have a save game in progress that hasn't completed the main quest yet, this mod will still work! However, it will calculate days passed from the very start of your character rather than from when you install this mod, so you may need to adjust the MCM expiry date as soon as you load in so you don't trigger the apocalypse right away (the timer is set to 365 by default, so any character that's more than a year old will need to be treated proactively).\n<br />\n<br />[b]COMPATIBILITY\n<br />[/b]This mod should be fully compatible and will work as expected with just about everything, even mods like Alternate Start. The only mods that may not play nice are those that manipulate the vanilla \"GameDaysPassed\" GlobalVariable, but I don't really know of any that do.\n<br />\n<br />This mod can also be used side-by-side with the Dawnguard version of End Times, if you want to fight off two apocalypses at once.\n<br />\n<br />I would like to reiterate, since it gets asked frequently, that while this mod DOES work with Alternate Start, the timer will still begin during character creation, not when you visit Helgen."
