nexusDescription="[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/xCHWETA.jpg[/img][/center][center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]THANKS FOR HELPING ME HIT HOT-FILES&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]rKpaMX1DzVw[/youtube][/size][/center][center][font=Times New Roman][size=4][b]~ D E S C R I P T I O N ~[/b]\r<br />\r<br />- UPDATED TO 2.0 - [/size][size=3]see changlelog[/size][size=4] -\xa0\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/font]This mod is a mesh and texture replacer for the freestanding stone walls in skyrim (like the ones along the road outside Riverwood). There are also optional installs for new stone walls in towns (the terrace style walls) as well as a plugin file which will replace the stone walls around Whiterun&#39;s farms with a new third variety of wall/fence.\r<br />\r<br />- WHY? -\r<br />\r<br />I was unhappy with the mostly flat single-piece mesh that Bethesda created. Hardware is more robust now, so a higher poly model was the goal. \xa0[b]The wall is now made of actual stacked stones[/b]. I live in New England, and there are remnants of old stone walls like this all over the place. They were used to delineate borders between farmland. This was the inspiration for this mod. \r<br />\r<br />[u][font=Times New Roman][size=4][b]~ I N S T A L L A T I O N ~\r<br />[/b]\r<br />[/size][/font][/u]I have made a FOMOD installer, so you just have to pick from the options presented to you.\r<br />\r<br />[u][font=Times New Roman][size=4][b]~ C O M P A T I B I L I T Y ~[/b][/size][/font][/u][u][font=Times New Roman][size=4][b]\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/size][/font][/u]Since this mod replaces the base mesh for the walls, any texture replacer you were using for StoneWall01 won&#39;t work. It&#39;s either the vanilla mesh and whatever texture you want, or my mesh and my texture. I&#39;m willing to upload tweaked versions of the texture, within reason, if it doesn&#39;t look right for your setup.\r<br />\r<br />There is an option in the installer to replace the hand-placed walls from\xa0[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68782/?]Enhanced Landscapes[/url] with my new wall meshes. I have re-done the collision for these meshes as EL&#39;s had a few issues. You must have EL installed for this option to work. I highly recommend the mod if you&#39;re looking to add more visual interest to Skyrim&#39;s sometimes barren worldspace.\r<br />\r<br />[u][font=Times New Roman][size=4][b]~ N O T E S ~\r<br />[/b][/size][/font][/u]\r<br />\r<br />I have also re-worked the Ivy growing on the walls. It&#39;s much higher poly, and has a new high-res texture for the vines and leaves. I think it&#39;s much more realistic than Bethesda&#39;s Ivy. You&#39;ll find the optional available in the FOMOD installer.[/center]"
