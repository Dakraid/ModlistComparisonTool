nexusDescription="This mod changes the body [b][color=#ffff00]normal maps[/color][/b] for vanilla races according to their body weight, so they can visually reflect their physical fitness.\n<br />Heavier means more ripped.\n<br />\n<br />Best of all: [b]it has zero performance impact on your game[/b]!\n<br />You see, Skyrim has always been capable of doing this, but vanilla game doesn't use this capability.\n<br />\n<br />I originally created this mod as an optional download for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32579]Sandow Plus Plus[/url], but I ultimately decided to add it as a separate mod, since this doesn't really need Sandow Plus Plus to work.\xa0\n<br />You can think about them as companion mods.\n<br />\n<br />Another companion mod to form the trifecta is [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34593]this Bodyslide preset[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][b][color=#e69138]How to use[/color][/b]\n<br />[/size]It has 6 levels of muscle definition:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Low[/b]. Going from 0 to 16.99 body weight.\n<br />[*][b]Low-extra[/b]. \xfeffGoing from 17 to 33.99 body weight.\n<br />[*][b]Medium[/b]. Going from 34 to 50.99 body weight.\n<br />[*][b]Medium-extra[/b]. Going from 51 to 67.99 body weight.\n<br />[*][b]High[/b]. Going from 68 to 83.99 body weight.\n<br />[*][b]High-extra[/b]. Going from 84 to 100 body weight.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][color=#ffff00][size=5]You need to provide your own [u]normal map[/u] textures,[/size][/color][/b] renaming them accordingly.\xa0\n<br />It all depends on what texture mod you are using.\n<br />\n<br />Fortunately, [color=#ffff00][size=5][b]I've already packed the textures\xa0you've seen in the sample pictures[/b][/size][/color]. \n<br />You can use them as a template and overwrite them if you want to use other normal maps.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The male textures are kindly provided as is by\xa0[url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/9916407-traa108/]traa108[/url]'s excellent\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7902]Tempered Skins for Males - Vanilla and SOS versions[/url].\n<br />[*]The female textures are modifications I made myself\xa0to the epic\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10306]Leyenda Skin[/url]. I got the blessing of its author,\xa0[url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/7960590-heroedeleyenda/]HeroedeLeyenda[/url], to publish them.\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1630457]MONSTERaider[/url]\xfeff gave me permission to modify and distribute his Khajiit and Argonian textures, so beast races are now supported from v1.2 and on!\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Thanks to both of you, guys! You are awesome!\n<br />\n<br />I highly suggest you to use them both, especially if you use the normal maps I provide... unless you want...\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][b][color=#e69138]Neck and wrist seams[/color][/b]\n<br />[/size]If using this mod gives you them, it means your hand/face normal maps don't match with the body ones provided by this mod. \n<br />For example, you are using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/798]Fair Skin[/url] as a base, but installed my normals, which were made for Leyenda. Or worse, you are using my CBBE textures for a UNP body... you get the idea.\n<br />\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]The easiest way to solve this is to install Tempered Skins for males and Leyenda for females and be done.\n<br />[*]If you don't like them for some reason (why???) or you are using UNP/7B/whathever, you'll need to find proper normal maps for whatever skin texture/body type you're using (incidentally, Leyenda is available for UNP too and there's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8505]Tempered Skins for Females - UNP and Vanilla[/url]). \n<br />In this case however, you would need to overwrite the textures provided by me.\n<br />[/list][color=#e69138][b][size=6]Credits[/size]\n<br />[/b][/color][list]\n<br />[*]Again, I want to thank [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/7960590-heroedeleyenda/]HeroedeLeyenda[/url], [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/9916407-traa108/]traa108[/url] and\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1630457]MONSTERaider[/url] for being so nice to me when asking permission to use their hard work.\n<br />[*]I got the idea on how to do this from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31910]Toned Amazons[/url]\xfeff. Further research showed me it was possible for men too and... here we are.\n<br />[*]For a change, I think Bethesda needs an explicit \"thank you\" (all Skyrim mods are possible thanks to them. Thanking them should be implicit, I believe), since they did all the hard work. All I did was adding some texture sets in the CK.\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16731]Fitness Body[/url]\xfeff. I modified Leyenda normal maps using it. I had to modify some of the included textures too, but that's besides the point.\n<br />[/list]"
