You do NOT need every Creation Club item to use these patches. If you do have every item, feel free to select the merged patch at the bottom of the installer list.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][u][b]What do the patches do?[/b][/u][/center]\n<br />\n<br />The Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches apply Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch (USSEP) fixes to [url=http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Creation_Club]Creation Club content[/url] where necessary and also fix new bugs introduced by the Creation Club mods.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][u][b]How do I install this mod?[/b][/u][/center]\n<br />\n<br />I recommend using either the Vortex, Mod Organizer 2 or Wrye Bash mod managers. For Vortex and Mod Organizer 2, attempting to install this mod will automatically bring up an installer. If you are using Wrye Bash, right-click on the mod in your Install tab and choose Wizard to begin the installation process. Then select which patches you would like to apply.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][u][b]Why doesn't one of the Creation Club items have a patch?[/b][/u][/center]\n<br />\n<br />There can be two reasons for this. One is that if the item has very recently been released, I'm likely still working on a patch for it. Alternatively, if it's a bit older, it's likely because it doesn't have any bugs that I have found.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][center][b]Where can I find a list of the bugs this fixes?[/b][/center][/u]\n<br />\n<br />The list of bugs fixed can be accessed under the Logs tab in the changelog dropdown. This will show the bugs fixed with each version of the mod.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][b][u]What languages is this mod available in?[/u][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />This mod is localized, meaning that translations will appear correctly in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Polish and Russian without needing separate versions. You don't need a separate download to support any of these languages.[/size][/color][/font]"
