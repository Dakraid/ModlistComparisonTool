nexusDescription="Small mod that fixes the CTDs that some users, including me, have encountered when they use the mod Wonders of Weather and the splash effect hits the Dragon Mounds. For an unknown reason when the WoW splash effect meshes collide with the mound meshes the game crashes. This fix using an alternative method to display the mounds in the game world and this new way solves the problem.\n<br />\n<br />Requirements: Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.\n<br />\n<br />Installation:  choose a version and places the BSA with the ESP inside the Data folder then activate it. Or use a mod manager.\n<br />\n<br />Loading order: any position after USSEP should be fine.\n<br />\n<br />Compatibility: I found only one mod that modifies the Dragon Mounds. The mod is called Landscape and Water Fixes and my fix is compatible. The mod It is not necessary but I recommend using it because it fixes many small bugs that no other mod fixes.\n<br />\n<br />Conflicts: None for now. If you encounter any problems please report them to me.\n<br />\n<br />The alternative splash effect has no correlation with crash correction. They are simply three meshes with different versions of rain splashes. Those who wish can use them."
