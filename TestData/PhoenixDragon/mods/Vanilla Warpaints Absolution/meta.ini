Many of the paints follow closely to the idea of the original vanilla ones, but with a much higher level of detail put into them. As such, one has a much greater amount of freedom in the warpaints they can use on their character, such as using a previously male only paint on a female character, and vise versa.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cfe2f3][size=4]Whats included?\n<br />[/size][/color]   \xfeff\x41ll 121 vanilla warpaints/tattoos redone by hand, as well as with adjustments for every race. So, you can use something that would normally only look correct on a Khajiit, on a Female Character, Male Character, or Argonian Character. Male and Female paints have been refitted to each other, as well as used to create designs for Khajiit and Argonian characters.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cfe2f3][size=4]Whats planned for the future?\n<br />[/size][/color]   \xfeffI plan on redoing some of these again in a style different to that of the vanilla paint it is based on (as right now I tried to stick relatively close to the examples when it comes to whether a paint was weathered, faded, solid etc.) The will be released as optional files, which will specify exactly what they replace. I.E. A file which allows you to replace the textures of the wood elves paints to look as if they were made with a different paint medium.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]-[url=https://discord.gg/Sg8tQXc]Discord Server[/url]-\xa0(Come here to check on progress of mods I am making, as well as chat or ask for help)\n<br />\n<br />-[url=https://twitter.com/DomainWolf?lang=en]Twitter[/url]\xfeff- (I post news and such on upcoming mods here!)\n<br />\n<br />-[url=https://www.patreon.com/domainwolf]Patreon[/url]- (Just a way for people to support me if they wish)\n<br />\n<br />-[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/94084]Oldrim Version[/url]-\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5]-Requirements-\n<br />[/size][/color][size=3][url=https://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url][/size] - This is required to use tintmasks of much higher quality than what is allowed in vanilla.\n<br />(For RaceMenu Files) [size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/]RaceMenu[/url][/size] - You will need this to be able to use the RaceMenu files provided by this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5]-Main Files Descriptions- (These are all a part of the FOMOD installer now)\n<br />[/size][/color]All of these files come in 2K and 4K versions.[color=#00ffff][size=5]\n<br />[/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][i]-Please note that in order for the warpaints to show up at full resolution, you will (probably) need SKSE installed, as well as its config setup to allow usage of higher resolution tintmasks, this is gone more in depth later-[/i][/color]\xfeff\xa0\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#cfe2f3]-RaceMenu All in One-[/color]\n<br />[/size]   \xfeffThis file contains every warpaint adjusted for Male Humanoid, Female Humanoid, Khajiit, and Argonian characters. These can all be found under the RaceMenu \"Makeup\" section.\n<br />   \xfeff\x43hoose this file if you want both Humanoid Warpaints, as well as Beast Race Warpaints, as the scripts their specific files use to add the warpaints to RaceMenu are not compatible with each other.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cfe2f3][size=4]-RaceMenu Humanoids-[/size][/color]\n<br />\xfeff   \xfeffThis file contains every warpaint adjusted for Male and Female Humanoid characters (Humans, Elves, and Orcs).

This applies to anything that would normally be accessible using the Warpaints selector in the vanilla character creation process. This file does not require RaceMenu to be used, and should come in handy for anyone whom wants HD Warpaints without it.\n<br />   \xfeff\x43hoose this file if you want to replace the vanilla textures used during vanilla character creation, as well as if you do not have RaceMenu installed.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5]-Variant Files Descriptions (Found inside the FOMOD Variants section)-\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color][color=#cfe2f3][size=4]-General Humanoid Variants 1 (WaterColors)-[/size][/color]\n<br />   \xfeffThis file replaces the textures normally associated with the generic humanoid paints (i.e. femaleheadwarpaint_01, maleheadwarpaint_06, etc.). These are done in a quality that resembles water color, as well as some being a bit more solid than those included in the default files. You should have either the All-In-One RaceMenu file, or the Humanoids RaceMenu File installed if you wish to install the RaceMenu versions of these. Otherwise, the vanilla replacer will work with or without the vanilla replacer installed (though you will still need SKSE setup for the tintmasks)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cfe2f3][size=4]-Wood Elf Variants 1 (Muddy)-[/size][/color][color=#cfe2f3][size=4]\n<br />[/size][/color]   \xfeffThis files replaces the wood elf warpaints for both males and females, for use with either the Humanoid/All in One RaceMenu or Vanilla Replacer files.

Inside of RaceMenu, shortly after the normal character customization options, you will find the Makeup section, with a list of textures inside. To select a texture to add to your character, press \"T\" over one of the values that show up, which will bring up a large list of all the warpaints you have available to you.\n<br />   \xfeff At the bottom there should be a search bar, which you can type into to specify what you are looking for.\xa0To help the user to find the warpaints that will best fit the character they are using, all warpaints added by the mod come with the prefix VWA, and followed by that the fitting of warpaint you are looking for (i.e. Male, Female, Khajiit, Argonian - which can then be followed by the race.) \n<br />   \xfeffThus, typing into the search bar in the texture lists \"VWA Male Wood Elf\", will pull up all the Wood Elf paints that were designed/adjusted for male humanoids from the mod. Another example would be \"VWA Khajiit Warpaint\" which would bring up the generic warpaints available to all humanoid races, in a style which fits on the khajiit face/uses the design in an interesting way.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5]-Installation-\n<br />[/size][/color]   \xfeffInstallation is simple, simply extract the files find the version you wish to use, then move its contents to your data directory. Otherwise, you may use Vortex or NMM to install by choosing download with Vortex/NMM in the files section.\n<br />[color=#cfe2f3][size=4]-Uninstallation-\n<br />[/size][/color]   \xfeffIf you installed using Vortex NMM, or any other mod organizer, you will likely be able to uninstall using it.\n<br />   \xfeffTo uninstall the mod for RaceMenu, you may disable the mods esp, as well as delete the folder for the mods textures found here \"textures/actors/character/Overlays/VWA\", if using the vanilla replacer.\n<br />   \xfeffTo uninstall the mod for the vanilla replacer,\xa0 delete any warpaints you do not want to have in your \"textures/actors/character/characterassets/tintmasks\", and the game should revert to using the default low-res vanilla warpaints.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5]-Setting up SKSE for HD Tintmasks-[/size][/color]\n<br />Navigate to your SKSE directory in data, and create/open the SKSE.ini file (you can save as \"All file types\" and add the .ini after).\n<br />(This is atleast required if you are using SKSE, and want the paints to appear at full resolution)\n<br />\n<br />Inside, you should add/find [Display]\n<br />underneath this, you should add\n<br />iTintTextureResolution=2048 (or whatever size textures you are looking to use.)\n<br />\n<br />Here is an example of the contents of SKSE.ini file with the texture resolution set to 2048x2048\n<br />\n<br />[General]\n<br />EnableDiagnostics=0\n<br />ClearInvalidRegistrations=1\n<br />[Display]\n<br />iTintTextureResolution=2048\n<br />[Memory]\n<br />defaultHeapInitialAllocMB=768\n<br />scrapHeapSizeMB=256\n<br />\n<br />Otherwise, if you wish to, you can use a premade config from the miscellaneous files of this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5]-Thanks for taking a look at the mod, and hope you enjoy my work-\n<br />[/size][/color][img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482276006762250250/501933046774104064/Ovalf_Draw_In.png?width=804&amp;height=453[/img][color=#00ffff][size=5]\n<br />-My Other Mods-\n<br />[/size][/color]Here are links to some of my other mods I have made, many of which are focused on character customization, hopefully some of them come in handy.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22487][img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482276006762250250/533878331960066048/Button_1.png?width=360&amp;height=233[/img][/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25204][img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482276006762250250/573975780384571405/Button.png?width=321&amp;height=181[/img][/url][img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482276006762250250/487488926018306058/WNB_Button.png?width=255&amp;height=270[/img][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20183][img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482276006762250250/492226137699909632/SFO_Button.png?width=296&amp;height=270[/img][/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20446][img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482276006762250250/487488775149191178/BRB_Button.png?width=335&amp;height=270[/img][/url]\xfeff\xfeff[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20445][img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482276006762250250/487453856918405121/BFCB_Button.png?width=217&amp;height=271[/img][/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20447][img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482276006762250250/496797175062331425/Natureborn_Button.png?width=227&amp;height=270[/img][/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21239/][img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482276006762250250/512023097356976149/Button.png?width=316&amp;height=271[/img][/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24495][img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482276006762250250/560161780001669121/Button.png?width=321&amp;height=229[/img][/url]\xfeff[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16561][img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482276006762250250/487489983683231744/Lupine_Button.png?width=270&amp;height=270[/img][/url]"
