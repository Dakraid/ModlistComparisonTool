nexusDescription="[center][b][color=#b4a7d6][size=5]Pilgrim - A Reli[/size][/color][/b][b][color=#b4a7d6][size=5]gion Overhaul[/size][/color][/b][/center]\n<br />Pilgrim is a complete overhaul of Skyrim\x2019s religion system that adds dozens of new deities and with powerful shrine effects to the game. It also turns several priests in the hold capitals into vendors who sell thematically appropriate items such as amulets, potions, spells, and scrolls. The priests also offer services such as Cure Disease Potions and scrolls of Divine Intervention.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Pilgrim contains several custom map markers which will be displayed automatically if you use the awesome\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56123]CoMAP - Common Map Markers Addon Project[/url], which we highly recommend.\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]\n<br />[b][size=4]Pilgrims and Cultists\xa0[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Pilgrim adds two perks to the game, Pilgrim and Cultist respectively. The Pilgrim perk is in the Restoration tree, and it governs gods such as the Divines, Auriel, and the All-Maker. The Cultist perk is in the Conjuration tree, and it governs gods such the Daedra, Mannimarco, and Sithis.\n<br />\n<br />Both of these perks have two ranks, one at 30 and one at 60 of their respective. The first rank doubles the strength of the relevant shrines. The second rank adds a second, additional bonus that you receive when you are under the effect of the relevant shrines.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b][size=4]Prayer[/size][size=3]\xa0[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The first time you pray at a shrine, you will receive a Lesser Power called Prayer. This power will allow you to meditate in order to receive a blessing from the last shrine you prayed at. Prayer works with both Divine and Daedric shrines, and you do not need to have invested in either the Pilgrim or Cultist perks to use it.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Praying in this manner does not cure diseases (in fact, neither does praying at shrines--check the \x201cPriestly Vendors\x201d section for more important on how to cure diseases with this mod).\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6][size=4]The Shrines\xa0[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[b][color=#ffe599][i]The Divines[/i][/color][i]\n<br />[/i][/b][/size]\n<br />The Divines are the most commonly worshiped gods in the land. They have numerous temples, amulets, and shrines located around the world. They are governed by the Pilgrim perk in Restoration.\n<br />[color=#ffe599]\n<br /> [/color][color=#ffe599][spoiler][b]Akatosh[/b] - You gain 10/20% more experience. / You have 25 extra Health, Magicka, and Stamina.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]Arkay[/b] - Your Health is increased by 25/50. / Your Armor Rating is increased by 100.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Dibella[/b] - Your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 25/50%. / You have 100% Disease Resistance.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]Julianos[/b] - Your Magicka is increased by 25/50. / Your spells cost 10% less Magicka.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Kynareth[/b] - Your Stamina is increased by 25/50. / You move 10% faster and take 50% less damage from falling.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Mara[/b] - Your Magicka Regeneration is increased by 25/50%. / Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Stendarr [/b]- Your Health Regeneration is increased by 25/50%. / Blocking with a shield reduces incoming magic damage by 50%.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Talos[/b] - Your Shouts deal 25/50% extra damage. / Your Shout cooldown is reduced by 25%.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Zenithar[/b] - Your Carry Weight is increased by 25/50. / Your buying and selling prices are 25% better.\n<br />\n<br />Pilgrim also buffs the amulets of the Divines to match the power of their shrine bonuses.[/spoiler][/color][i][b][color=#6d9eeb][size=3]\n<br />[/size][/color][/b][/i][b][color=#6d9eeb][size=3][i]Other Benevolent Deities\xa0[/i][/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />These deities are worshipped by other cultures not native to Skyrim. Although their worship is less common, it is not usually perceived as malicious. Their shrines are rare, and may be more difficult to find. They are governed by the Pilgrim perk in Restoration.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][b][spoiler]Auriel[/b] - Your Magicka is increased by 25/50. / Your sun spells and enchantments work on the living, Daedra, and automatons.\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />HoonDing[/b] - Your Stamina is increased by 25/50. / You attack 20% faster when wielding a Onehanded weapon with an empty offhand.\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />Jephre[/b] - Your Stamina regeneration is increased by 25/50%. / You spend 25% less Stamina when power attacking or drawing a bow.\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />Jone and Jode[/b] - You deal 5/10 extra unarmed damage. / When you fall below half Stamina, your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 100%.\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />Magnus [/b]- You have 5/10% Spell Absorption. / You have 25% Magic Resist.\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />Pelinal[/b] - Your Armor Rating is increased by 50/100. / Power attacks deal 50% extra damage to enemies who are power attacking, drawing a bow, or casting a spell.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Phynaster[/b] - Your spells and enchantments cost 5/10% less. / When you fall below half Magicka, your Magicka regeneration is increased by 100%.\xa0\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />Sheor [/b]- You deal 5/10 extra unarmed damage. / When you fall below half Health, your Health regeneration is increased by 100%\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />Syrabane[/b] - Your Magicka Regeneration is increased by 25/50%. / Wards resist 50% of incoming physical damage.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Trinimac[/b] - Your Health is increased by 25/50. / You take 25% less damage while power attacking, drawing a bow, or casting a spell.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Y\x2019\x66\x66re[/b] - Your Stamina is increased by 25/50. / You move 20% faster with a bow equipped.[/spoiler][/color][color=#93c47d][b][size=3][i]\n<br />Tall Papa and The All-Maker\xa0[/i][/size][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />These two deities are listed separately because they have slightly more complex effects. They are governed by the Pilgrim perk in Restoration.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][spoiler][b]The All-Maker[/b] \xa0- The All-Maker does not have a single shrine. Instead, each of the six All-Maker Stones represent one aspect of his being.\xa0\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\n<br />\xa0 \xa0[b] \xa0The Beast Stone[/b] - You have 50/100% Disease Resistance. / When you enter combat, you call the Pride of Hirstaang to your side.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0[b]\xa0\xa0\xa0The Earth Stone[/b] - You have 50/100 Armor Rating. / Blocking with a shield reduces incoming power attack damage by 50%.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0[b]\xa0\xa0\xa0The Sun Stone - [/b]You have 25/50% Fire Resistance. / Your Health regenerates 50% faster in combat.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0[b]\xa0The Tree Stone [/b]- You have 25/50% Poison Resistance. / Your potions last 50% longer.\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0[b]The Water Stone [/b]- You have 25/50% Shock Resistance. / Your Magicka regenerates 50% faster in combat.\n<br />\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0[b]The Wind Stone[/b] - You have 25/50% Frost Resistance. / Your Stamina regenerates 50% faster in combat.\n<br />\n<br />Tall Papa - You gain 10/20% more experience. / You have an additional unique effect based on your Standing Stone.\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0[b]The Apprentice Stone[/b] - Your Magicka regenerates 50% faster in combat.\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0[b]The Atronach Stone [/b]- Your spells cost 25% less Magicka when you have a staff equipped.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0[b]\xa0\xa0\xa0The Lady Stone[/b] - You have 25 extra Health, Magicka, and Stamina.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Lord Stone[/b] - Your Health regenerates 50% faster in combat.\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0[b]The Lover Stone[/b] - Your Stamina regenerates 50% faster in combat.\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0[b]\xa0The Mage Stone [/b]- Your move 20% faster when you have a spell or a staff equipped.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />\xa0[b]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Ritual Stone[/b] - Your Conjuration spells cost 25% less.\n<br />\n<br />[b]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Serpent Stone[/b] - You have 2 extra Poison uses.\n<br />\n<br />\xa0[b]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Shadow Stone[/b] - You deal 25% extra damage with sneak attacks and spells.\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0[b]The Steed Stone[/b] - You move 10% faster, and your carry weight is increased by 50.\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0[b]The Thief Stone[/b] - You spend 25% less Stamina when power attacking or drawing a bow.\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0[b]\xa0The Tower Stone[/b] - You reflect 100% of incoming melee damage back at your opponent.\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0[b]\xa0\xa0The Warrior Stone[/b] - You take 25% less damage while power attacking, drawing a bow, or casting a spell.[/spoiler][/color][i][b][color=#dd7e6b][size=3]\n<br />[/size][/color][/b][/i][b][color=#dd7e6b][size=3][i]The Daedra and Other Malevolent\xa0\x44\x65ities\xa0[/i][/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />These deities are dark gods whose worship is shunned by polite society. They are, for the most part, Daedric Princes, although a few other malevolent entities are presented here. The powers these gods provide are much more volatile, and extract a great cost from their worshippers. They are governed by the Conjuration perk Cultist.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#dd7e6b][spoiler][b]Azura[/b] - Your Magicka is increased by 25/50. / Your weapon enchantments are twice as strong, but cost five times as much.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Boethiah[/b] - Your Stamina is increased by 25/50. / You reduce the armor rating of all nearby enemies by up to 300, but your own armor rating is reduced by 300.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Clavicus Vile[/b] - Buying and selling prices are 10/20% better. / Scrolls are twice as strong, and you find scrolls much more often, but your Magicka is permanently depleted.\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />Hermaeus Mora[/b] - You have a 5/10% chance to absorb the Magicka from incoming spells. /\xa0 Spells and enchantments cost 50% less, but your Magic Resistance is reduced by 50%.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Hircine[/b] - You deal 5/10 extra unarmed damage. / Your unarmed power attacks deal 50% extra damage, but cost three times more Stamina.\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />Malacath[/b] - You have 25/50 Stamina. /\xa0 Power attacks are 50% stronger, but all other attacks are half as strong.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Mannimarco[/b] - Your Conjuration spells cost 10/20% less. / You can reanimate two additional zombies, but when you do not control at least one reanimated zombie, your Armor Rating is reduced by 300 and your Magic Resistance is reduced by 50%.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Mehrunes Dagon[/b] - Destruction spells cost 10/20% less. / You reduce the Fire, Frost, Shock, and Poison Resistance of all nearby enemies by up to 50%, but your own Fire, Frost, Shock, and Poison Resistance are reduced by 50%.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Mephala[/b] - Your Health is increased by 25/50. / You deal 50% extra damage to enemies who fall below half Health, but you take double damage when you fall below half Health.\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />Meridia[/b] - Restoration spells cost 10/20% less. / Sun spells deal 50% more damage, but Fire, Frost, Shock, and Poison spells deal 50% less damage.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Molag Bal [/b]- You have 25/50 extra Magicka. / You cannot regenerate Magicka, but you absorb 10 points of Magicka per second from nearby enemies.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Namira[/b] - You have 50/100% Disease Resistance. / When you feed on a corpse, your Health regenerates twice as fast. When you have not fed, you cannot regenerate Health.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Nocturnal[/b] - You are 10/20% better at sneaking. / You take 50% extra damage from all sources, but sneaking in combat turns you ethereal for five seconds.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Peryite[/b] - Your potions last 25/50% longer. / You reduce the Poison Resistance of all nearby enemies by up to 50%, but your own Poison Resistance is reduced by 100%.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Sanguine[/b] - You have 25/50% Health Regeneration. / Potions last three times as long, but when you are not under the effect of a potion, your Movement Speed is reduced by 50% and you cannot regenerate Stamina.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Sheogorath [/b]- Alteration spells cost 10/20% less. / You take 50% more damage from melee weapons, but you reflect 200% of incoming melee damage back at your attacker.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Sithis [/b]- You are 10/20% better at sneaking. / Sneak attacks with One-handed weapons deal 50% more damage, but all other attacks deal 50% less.\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />Vaermina[/b] - Illusion spells cost 10/20% less. / Illusion spells last half as long, but they reduce enemy Armor Rating by 150 and Magic Resistance by 25%. This effect is reversed for Command spells.[/spoiler][/color]\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][size=4][b]Priestly Vendors\xa0[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Pilgrim turns one priest in each of the five major cities into a special class of vendor. These priests will sell a few spell tomes, but more importantly, they will sell healing and defensive items such as potions and scrolls. They will also sell special scrolls of Divine Intervention. These scrolls will allow you to teleport to their respective temples. If you are an Expert or above in Restoration, you will be able to buy a spell of Divine Intervention from each of the five priests, which will allow you to teleport to their temple without consuming an item.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Since shrines no longer cure diseases in Pilgrim, the priests will be sure to stock extra potions of Cure Disease. You may wish to purchase a few before embarking on a long journey.\xa0\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]\n<br />[size=4]Compatibility\xa0[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Pilgrim is not compatible with other religion overhauls. Pilgrim [i]is [/i]compatible with all Standing Stone overhauls (if you were worried about Tall Papa).\n<br />\n<br />Pilgrim is compatible with Adamant without a patch. It will overwrite any effects from Adamant, so if there are any discrepancies between the two mods, Pilgrim will win. You should make sure to use the latest version of Adamant and Mysticism. You should not use the \x201c\x41\x64\x61mant Shrines and Amulets\x201d plugin with this mod.\xa0 \n<br />\n<br />If you\x2019\x64 like to use Pilgrim with Ordinator, Vokrii, or Vanilla perks, you\x2019ll need to download one of the patches we\x2019ve provided. The Vokrii patch changes Auriel's buff since Auriel's functionality is already included in Vokrii as a perk.\n<br />\n<br />Pilgrim does edit the Vanilla magic effects for Sun Fire, Vampire\x2019s Bane, and Stendarr\x2019s Aura in order to implement Auriel\x2019s \x201c\x42\x61thed in Light\x201d ability. Sorry, there's no other way to implement this effect.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />There are no Vanilla keywords for Poison and Sun magic, so for this mod to recognize spells as either Poison or Sun spells, you should add my keywords to them (MAG_MagicDamagePoison and MAG_MagicDamageSun, respectively). These keywords are injected. You will also need to manually implement Bathed in Light similar to how it was done with Vanilla spells. We have provided a patch for Odin that does this already.\n<br />\n<br />Pilgrim is compatible with Breton Paladin with the patch provided. \n<br />\n<br />If you want to add Pilgrim support to your own mod without need of a patch, you can find an article detailing how [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/3324]here[/url].\n<br />[size=4]\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6][size=4]Credits[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][b][u]Special Thanks[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]TateTaylorUSA [/b]for the Shrine of Sithis as well as everything done in the render window.\n<br />[b]SoftboiRodvt [/b]for the Dunmer House of Troubles Shrines.\n<br />[b]opusGlass [/b]for the Shrine of HoonDing.\n<br />[b]FrankFamily [/b]for allowing us to use his unreleased Shrines of Syrabane and Trinimac.\n<br />[b]colinswrath [/b]for contributing some script work.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Assets Used[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]billyro [/b]for the Shrine of Mannimarco taken from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79830]Billyro's Misc Mods[/url].\n<br />[b]cad435 [/b]for the Snow Elf Pavilion taken from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70099/]Snow Elves Reborn -
