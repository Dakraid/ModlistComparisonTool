nexusDescription="[b][size=5]What it does[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod removes the smoke/fog in the main menu and loading screens.\xa0\n<br />It's very useful for main menu background replacers and mods with image-like loading screens.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]The difference between this and similar mods[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />In the latest ENB update (version 0.454 from July 4th) Boris added the new feature that allows ENB to be automatically turned off in the main menu and in the load screens. No more oversaturated main menu background and custom loadscreens.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />It works by tracking the menu smoke mesh geometry. So if you have any mod that replaces this mesh with \"blank\" version, this feature will not work. The examples are\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/7901?tab=description]No Menu and Loading Smoke[/url],\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4634]Loading Screen Smoke Removed[/url] and maybe some others.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />This new mod replaces the vanilla menu smoke mesh with \"invisible\" one with similar geometry, so ENB feature could work as intended.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Compatibility[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Compatible with everything. Just overwrite any other mods containing this file.\xa0\n<br />May be safely installed or uninstalled mid-playthrough. It's simply a single mesh replacer.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Credits\xa0[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />All credit goes to Mitradis as it's he who created this mesh (he asked me to upload this file on Nexus).\n<br />If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comment section."
