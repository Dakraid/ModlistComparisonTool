nexusDescription="After Installing\xa0\x45\x61stern Dwemer Towers of Solstheim and travelling to Nchardak I noticed one of the added towers clipping with one added by Project AHO, this patch fixes that. The tower added by EDTS blocks the upper doorway of the Nchardak landing platform making the upper balcony inaccessible. To fix the problem the left tower added by EDTS has been removed to make room for the landing platform. I felt this was the best solution as the tower was one very large static object that couldn't be moved in a way that felt natural or lined up with the right tower, so now the building has two mismatched towers that serve different purposes.\n<br />\n<br />This mod does not modify or use any assets from Project AHO and can be used without it. Also works with the standalone player home\xa0\x41HO - Dwemer Ship."
