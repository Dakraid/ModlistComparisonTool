nexusDescription="I noticed that when he was in a fight, sometimes my horse would trot - so I went looking for that animation set. I then used these in place of the 'run' animations to make the horse trot when ridden, rather than going from a walk straight into canter. It makes the movement from standing a little more realistic, as horses have to work up to speed and get all their legs organised! The player rides like a sack of potatoes, but not much I can do about that!\n<br />\n<br />This is just a simple anim replacer that came about by something I spotted in game, so all credit really goes to Bethesda for making the anim files. I can't animate my way out of a paper bag! :)\n<br />\n<br />This does not affect horse speed, either in the base game or mods.\n<br />[b][i]\n<br />Please do not upload this file anywhere else.[/i][/b]"
