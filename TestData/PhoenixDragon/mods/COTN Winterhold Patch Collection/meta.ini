nexusDescription="It's me again, working at resolving potential conflicts with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40088]Cities of the North - Winterhold[/url]. Each mod which has a patch is listed below, with specific details of all changes contained in spoilers, if necessary. All patches are ESP flagged as ESL, unless otherwise noted. I'm certainly more experienced than before, but I'm always learning, so if you run into trouble, please let me know and we'll see if we can work it out.\n<br />\n<br />Please remember that patches sometimes involve Persistent references, so they will require a new save/playthrough. Before making a request for help, please double check that the problem exists on such a new save.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Included Patch Descriptions[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194]3DNPCs/Interesting NPCs[/url] - shifts placed objects/markers to match new interiors.

Patch attempts to replicate the intention behind ELFX to the new interiors, however, due to engine limitations a few compromises were made. I'm looking for feedback on this one, for any interested. No changes made to the newly-added cell. If using ELFX Fixes, load after ELFX Fixes.

Forwards COTN with any conflicts. Effectively disables TGC's changes for Winterhold, allowing COTN to be used. Any TGC patches will need to be handled by the end user. New game is absolutely, 100% required. Last checked against version 2.01. An alternative patch can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54097]over here[/url] \xfeff\x62y [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/73872203]Adrien2401[/url] which keeps TGC Winterhold layout, but changes the Jarl's Keep to use COTN Winterhold's\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22671]Guards Armor Replacer[/url] - Shifts placed armor to match new interior.

Edited packages to match new stuff. Last checked against version 1.60SE\n<br />\n<br />Large Trees - Resizes 6 trees from Skyrim.esm which clip through the bridge when using a mod which increases tree size. No master set, so \n<br />should work with any mod that increases tree size. Thanks to Deigue for the patch. Alternative version by altonjarrod is designed to work with Simply Bigger Trees, as well.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138]Landscape and Water Fixes[/url] - Forwards COTN Winterhold changes wherever appropriate, forwards ownership of the chicken nest from Landscape and Water Fixes.

This is quest related so it hasn't been fully tested yet, and as everything but a quest stage trigger are persistent objects, will require a new save. Last checked against version 2.7\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27094]Morrowloot Miscellania - Item Distribution[/url] - moves one placed book to match the new interior.

Thanks to EiraSvero for the patch. Last checked against version 1.4\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11076]Open Civil War[/url] - Consider this one a beta. There are two markers (for attack/defense) which previously were put over the Jarl's door as you exited the building. However, now the keep is way up at the top of the hill - I have moved this marker down to where the path ends, so it's close to town again. I presume going into this trigger is what starts the attack/defense (so you won't be way off away from the action at the top of the hill), but have not confirmed it. Please let me know if you run into any problems. Last checked against version 2.6.3.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2414]Snazzy Furniture and Clutter Overhaul[/url] - Shifts placed paintings to match new interiors and updates furniture to match theming.

Last checked against version 2.0\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Other patches that I'm aware of: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46359]Distinct Interiors[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42423?]Immersive Laundry[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46829]Keep it Clean[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Installation[/i][/size]\n<br />Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into your Skyrim data folder. Patches should have their appropriate masters set, and should be loaded after any mods which they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects, and may require a new save.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Compatibility[/i][/size]\n<br />I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods.
