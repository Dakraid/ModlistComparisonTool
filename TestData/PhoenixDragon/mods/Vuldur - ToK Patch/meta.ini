nexusDescription="[size=4][u][b]This was made for the .esp version of the mod.[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />This is just a couple of patches made to be used with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12186]Hammet's Dungeons for SSE[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />\n<br />The first patch adds skies to dungeon interiors - no more trees in the [i][b]void[/b][/i] in parts of dungeons where you can see outside.\n<br />The second patch moves the entrance of Frostgrim Hollows to make it accessible when [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14168]Tools of Kagrenac[/url] is present.\n<br />\n<br />The first patch can be used standalone with the original mod, however the ToK patch was made with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11052]Majestic Mountains[/url] in mind. I may come back and release a version of this without this requirement, but it's not on my list of priorities as this started out as a personal patch of sorts.\n<br />\n<br />Both patches are ESL flagged.\n<br />\n<br />Credits \n<br />venjhammet - For their wonderful [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12186]Hammet's Dungeons for SSE[/url]\xfeff mod and giving permission to upload these patches."
