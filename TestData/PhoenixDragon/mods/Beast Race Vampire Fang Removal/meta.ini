nexusDescription="This mod simply removes those dorky-looking fangs from male and female khajiit vampires. To do this, I had to edit the animation which changes facial expression in vampires, but I never touched any meshes, so it should be compatible with every conceivable face, head and body mesh out there. If there's any desire, I could probably be convinced to do the same for other races, now that I know how to do it.\n<br />\n<br />Use and distribute as much as you want, just mention my name if you use my work."
