nexusDescription="[size=3]Description\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />This is a comprehensive overhaul of the Soul Cairn. While it is mostly a retexture, it also fixes some mesh issues along the way. The textures follow the vanilla patterns, as the meshes often make use of it (i.e. certain stone wall and floor pieces are sticking out of the meshes making it necessary to preserve the vanilla texture pattern.\n<br />The [b]USSEP meshes[/b] as well as the [b]Skyrim Particle Patch meshes[/b] have been integrated into the mod.\n<br />The meshes' specular and gloss values are unified, as the vanilla ones were incongruent and absurdly high in some cases. Furthermore, the following issues have been remedied:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]The blending issues of some stone walls have been fixed. ([url=https://imgur.com/a/EXAgNiO]Before and After[/url]\xfeff)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Texture paths errors have been corrected: sc_chest.nif as well as sc_mausoleumwall03.nif had the wrong texture applied. ([url=https://imgur.com/a/X0m1bE4]Before and After[/url]\xfeff)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]The spire meshes had their normals smoothed to better hide their low polygon appearance.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]The chest glow has been fixed for ENB, thanks to mindflux!

Recommended for the bone meshes which are often found in the Soul Cairn, but I suggest trying out the others as well. Be careful though, high processing power required and some of the meshes have a few issues, so check them in Nifskope before using.)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12029]High Poly Project[/url]\xfeff by LucidAPs (Also contains some high poly bone meshes.)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12371]Skyrim 3D Trees[/url]\xfeff by mathy79 (Incredible Trees for the Soul Cairn, even though some of them clip.
