nexusDescription="[i][color=#e06666]Blood Horkers are a more predatory version of their mainland cousins, native to Solstheim's icy shores.\n<br />\n<br />They use the fleshy proboscis that extends from their mouths for feeding: Small prey such as fish and crab are sucked up through the siphon-like proboscis and mauled by the horker's teeth. Larger prey, including the occasional Nord, are impaled by the horker's long tusks and drained of blood, earning the foul creature its name.[/color][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4][b]This mod adds a new creature: the Blood Horker. \n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/88253-0-1512551433.gif[/img][/center][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff0000][size=4]Why?[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />The Blood Horker was designed to improve lore consistency between the TES5: Dragonborn DLC and the TES3: Bloodmoon DLC, as part of the Bloodmoon Creature Restoration Project. \n<br />Both DLCs are set on the island of Solstheim, yet many of the unique creatures seen in Bloodmoon have disappeared or been replaced by generic Skyrim creatures.\n<br />I aim to fix that!\n<br />[size=1](Also, it's December, maybe I just wanted to do Christmas colors.)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff0000][size=4]Features[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />-All horkers on Solstheim have been replaced with Blood Horkers.\n<br />-The unique horker on Horker Island has been given a unique skin.\n<br />-Other than the worldspace references and the one unique horker, no vanilla records have been edited, so this should be nearly universally compatible.\n<br />-Any changes to horker stats or behavior (by SkyTEST etc) will be inherited by my horkers for consistency.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This 25-sec teaser video isn't very informative, but at least you can see them animated!
