nexusDescription=Thank you to\xa0wizkid34 for Landscape and Water Fixes and\xa0JonnyWang13 for Cathedral Mountain Flowers.\n<br />\n<br />Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes changes the placement of some mountain flowers and adds some locational references. Cathedral mountain Flowers changes the model. The main patch combines the records from both mods.\n<br />\n<br />The other patches do the same for Cathedral Mountain Flowers and some other mods which also change the placement of some mountain flowers. These are minor in that only a few records are affected for each mod. They are:\n<br />\n<br />Cutting Room Floor\n<br />Lanterns of Skyrim II\n<br />Winterhold Restored\n<br />Helgen Reborn\n<br />JK Skyrim\n<br />Unique Border Gates\n<br />Skyrim Realistic Conquering - All in One\n<br />Skyrim Reborn Hjallmarch Hold\n<br />\n<br />The patch for Skyrim Reborn Hjaalmarch Hold also requires the CRF patch found on the SR Hjaalmarch Hold files page.\n<br />\n<br />All patches are flagged as ESL and won't count towards your load order.
