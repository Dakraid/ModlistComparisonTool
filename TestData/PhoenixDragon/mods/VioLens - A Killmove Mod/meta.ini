This feature can also be combined with Left Attacks so that all the Killmoves can be triggered with both Right/Power and Left/Power Attacks.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Q6: [/b][/color]Why are there two different settings for Ranged Killmoves?\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]A6: [/b][/color]There are two different settings for Ranged Killmoves instead of just an On/Off Toggle because of the way Skyrim handles Magic Killmoves vs Archery Killmoves.  When the .ini setting bVATSIgnoreProjectileTest is set to 0, Magic Killmoves will play more consistently and Archery Killmoves will play less consistently.  When bVATSIgnoreProjectileTest is set to 1, Archery Killmoves will play more consistently, but Magic Killmoves will rarely ever play.  VioLens can switch between these settings for you if you set the Selection Mode to Automatic.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Q7: [/b][/color]Why do Ranged Killmoves play even when I didn't kill my target, or even worse, when I miss?\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]A7: [/b][/color]This is just the way Ranged Killmoves work in Skyrim. \xa0They weren't implemented very well, and as a result, you might get Ranged Killmoves when you shouldn't.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Q8: [/b][/color]Why doesn't Killmove Chance 100% mean 100%?!\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]A8: [/b][/color]Killmoves can be fickle because of the odd way they're implemented into Skyrim.  For Melee Killmoves, if you want to see as many killmoves as possible, you need to turn Last Enemy Restriction off, be on even terrain, be positioned in front or behind your target correctly, and be aiming right at your target.  For Ranged Killmoves, it's the same deal with Last Enemy Restriction, but they are overall less consistent and \"Quirky\" than Melee Killmoves and may not always trigger when they should.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Q9: [/b][/color]What is VATS?\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]A9: [/b][/color]VATS or V.A.T.S. stands for Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System.\xa0 Skyrim uses a modified version of the Fallout 3 engine, so the Ranged Killmoves they've implemented as well as the Cinematic Cameras used for Melee Killmoves are a part of what's left over from VATS.\xa0 VioLens allows you to disable VATS in-game via the MCM, which turns off any Cinematic Cameras and Ranged Cameras in the game. \xa0This option in the MCM toggles the bVATSDisable setting in the Skyrim.ini file between 0 and 1. \xa0If you've added this line to your Skyrim.ini file, it will be overwritten by VioLens' MCM toggle. \xa0You do not have to remove or add this line to your Skyrim.ini file, VioLens will take care of it.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Q10: [/b][/color]Why does the Sleeper Hold Killmove Camera linger for so long?\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]A10:[/b][/color] The standard 3rd Person Camera for it is a bit broken, but if you're using the 3rd Person Static Camera, or have VATS disabled, you shouldn't run into this problem.\xa0 If you don't want to use those options, then I'd suggest not using the Killmove at all if it bothers you.\xa0 Nope, I can't fix it.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Q11: [/b][/color]What's the deal with \"Seated Killmoves\"?\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]A11:[/b][/color] This option lets you perform Stealth Killmoves on NPCs that are sitting on stuff. \xa0It's possible that performing a killmove on a sitting NPC may cause their body to get stuck in whatever they were sitting on or the positioning of the killmove may be off.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Q12: [/b][/color]Why isn't VioLens showing up in the Mod Configuration Menu?\xa0 How do I get it to show up?\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]A12:[/b][/color] It's just taking longer than usual, try waiting  a few hours using the in-game wait feature.\xa0 If that doesn't work, open the console in-game with ~ and type [i][b]setstage SKI_ConfigManagerInstance 1[/b][/i].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Q13: [/b][/color]Why does everything have a $ infront of it in the MCM?\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]A13:[/b][/color] If you're seeing $ infront of things in the MCM, you either don't have the VioLens SE_ENGLISH.txt installed, or your Skyrim isn't in English.  If it's the former make sure the VioLens SE_ENGLISH.txt is placed in the [i][b]Data&#92;Interface&#92;Translations[/b][/i] Folder.\xa0 If it's the latter, either download your language from the optional files or, if your language isn't available, rename the VioLens SE_ENGLISH.txt to the correct language until your language becomes available.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Q14: [/b][/color]Which should I choose \"Loose\" or \"BSA\"? \n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]A14: [/b][/color]When it comes to VioLens, there shouldn't be any difference between the two, it's up to you how you want your files arranged and placed.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Q15: [/b][/color]Why is the Ranged Section of the MCM greyed out? \n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]A15: [/b][/color]The Ranged Section is greyed out for 1 of 2 reasons.\xa0 \n<br />\n<br />[b]1[/b]. You have [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52474/?]Combat Drama Overhaul[/url] installed, in which case you should be using its MCM to control Ranged Killmoves.\n<br />[b]2[/b]. You have VATS turned Off and it needs to be On in order for Ranged Killmoves to work.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Q16:\xa0[/b][/color]How do I trigger Stealth Killmoves?\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]A16:\xa0[/b][/color]Stealth Killmoves work the same way as normal killmoves, they play when you actually kill your target. \xa0This is a little more difficult with stealth because it means your weapon has to be strong enough to 1 shot your enemy. \xa0It should also be noted that the Neck/Sleeperhold killmoves can be a bit inconsistent, which may be why they were not used at all in the vanilla game. \xa0If you're having problems triggering stealth killmoves, try setting them to Throat Slit only as it is the most consistent stealth killmove.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Q17:\xa0[/b][/color]How many killmoves does this mod have compared to any other killmove mod?\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]A17:\xa0[/b][/color]VioLens makes use of every single killmove in the game with the exception of the \"Heart Breaker\" Killmove. \xa0There should be no killmoves present in other killmove mods that are not present in VioLens.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Q18:\xa0[/b][/color]VioLens is overwriting some files added by another mod, what should I do?\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]A18:\xa0[/b][/color]VioLens includes [url=https://github.com/schlangster/skyui-lib/wiki]UILib[/url] Version 1 for the profile system to work. \xa0These are resource files that may also be included with other mods.\xa0 It doesn't matter which mod's UILib files are overwriting the other one's, they should be identical.\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3][b]\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3][size=5][u][b]My Mods\n<br />[/b][/u][/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][size=4][b]Standard Edition[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9645/?]Black Mage Armor[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32598/?]Heart Breaker - A Killmove Mod[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56980/?]VioLens - A Killmove Mod[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][size=4][b]Special Edition[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[url=https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/2970997]VioLens - A Killmove Mod SE [XB1][/url]\n<br />[url=https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3021945]VioLens - A Killmove Mod SE [PS4][/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1847/?]Heart Breaker - A Killmove Mod SE[/url]\n<br />[url=https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3004993]Heart Breaker - A Killmove Mod SE [XB1][/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/356?]Black Mage Armor SE[/url]\n<br />[url=https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/2964245]Black Mage Armor SE [XB1][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3][size=5][u][b]Mods Used In Screenshots[/b][/u][/size][/color]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14356]Main Font Replacement - Fertigo Pro[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18943]Town Guards Armor Retexture[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988]XP32 Maximum Skeleton[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2357]Enhanced Blood Textures SE[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16886/?]Friendly Guard Helmets[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34155/?]Dual Sheath Redux[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9607]zzjay's Wardrobe[/url][size=2]\xa0[/size][color=#b4a7d6][b]Note:[/b][/color][size=2] This mod includes the armor used by my character.[/size]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5113]Dragonspear[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5490]Epoch Weapon Pack[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3][size=5][u][b]Translation Credits[/b][/u][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Russian: [/b][/color][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/4891508]kopasov[/url][/b][/color]"
