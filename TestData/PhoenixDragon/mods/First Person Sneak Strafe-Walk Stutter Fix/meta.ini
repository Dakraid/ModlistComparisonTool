nexusDescription="[b]What is this stutter?\n<br />[/b]This stutter only happens in a very specific case, which is you sneaking at walk-speed while moving diagonally forward and to the right.\n<br />While doing so you will encounter a visible camera stutter roughly every 2 seconds of walking, as long as you are in the 1st person view.\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]15rREECnEp0[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />Doing this in 3rd person, sneaking in any other direction, or at any other speed, will NOT cause this stutter to occur.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Why does it happen?\n<br />[/b]This specific stutter is completely unrelated to the performance of your game, or any of your settings.\n<br />It happens with locked and unlocked FPS, on 60Hz and 120+Hz, whether you use a mouse &amp; keyboard or a controller.\n<br />\n<br />This is because the only reason the stutter happens is that the specific animation used in this case (sneakwalk_frwrdright) is not looping correctly.\n<br />The start/end points of the animation do not align correctly.\n<br />\n<br />[b]How does the fix work?\n<br />[/b]Because 1st person animation can't easily be modified, and no mod that changes the 1st person sneak animations exists (to my knowledge), I chose to solve it in the most simple way possible. I replaced the forward+right animation (sneakwalk_frwrdright) with the forward+left animation (sneakwalk_frwrdleft).\n<br />\n<br />[b]Why was this never found/reported?\n<br />[/b]No idea. I actually found only two reports of this problem, ever, years ago on the /r/skyrimmods subreddit, neither of which got any responses.\n<br />It was most likely regarded as just another stutter, which is present in both LE/SE.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation/Uninstallation\n<br />[/b]Install it either via MO2/Vortex, or by manually placing the extracted folder in your Data directory.\n<br />Remove the mod, or delete the folder, to uninstall it.\n<br />\n<br />Since this is just a single animation file, there are no possible issues with un-/installing it mid-playthrough.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known issues\n<br />[/b]None. This animation is obviously only used while in 1st person view, so you will only ever see it from your own perspective.\n<br />And since 1st person animations actually only animate the player's hands you won't even notice a difference (except for the now missing stutter!)."
