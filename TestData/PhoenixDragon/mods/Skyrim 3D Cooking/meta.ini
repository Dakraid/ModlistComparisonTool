nexusDescription="[img]https://i.imgur.com/eRK7QAE.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[b][center]A complete remodel project of the kitchen appliances, pots and spits.[/center][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[u]CONTENT\n<br />[/u]Includes new models and textures for all the cooking related objects.\n<br />Includes 16 food replacer models. More in progress. \n<br />\n<br />Steam effects have been added on the cooking spit.\n<br />\n<br />[u]COMPATIBILITY\n<br />[/u]Probably compatible with everything as long as its given priority.\n<br />\n<br />[u]TEXTURES[/u]\n<br />All food and ingredients objects textures and normal maps are 1k\n<br />Appliances, pots etc texture resolution varies between 4k and 1k, depending on the object area that needs to be textured.\n<br />\n<br />[u]PERFORMANCE\n<br />[/u]All meshes are extremely optimized and they will not affect performance in any way. These are gaming models, this is not a high poly mod. \n<br />\n<br />[u]FAQ[/u]\n<br />[i]I like object A but i dont like object B. Can you make a version without object B please?\n<br />[/i]No. Download, unpack, get what you need, delete the rest.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Would you upload all 1k textures for people with old rigs?\n<br />[/i]No. Download paint.net and the dds extension and scale your textures to whatever resolution you like.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Can you make a version that would match my whatever texture pack?\n<br />[/i]No. \n<br />[i]\n<br />Oldrim version?\n<br />[/i]No. \n<br />\n<br />[i]May i offer ideas for improvement? [/i]\n<br />Yes, it would be very much appreciated"
