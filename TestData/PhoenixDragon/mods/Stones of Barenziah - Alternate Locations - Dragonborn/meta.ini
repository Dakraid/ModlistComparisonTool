Can't you just put them in a pack?\n<br />\n<br />A: They used to be in a pack called Andrealphus' Gameplay Tweaks. (which is now named [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27939]Andrealphus' Tweaks - Harder Quests[/url] \n<br />\n<br />However, since the title wasn't descriptive enough, many people were having issues finding a particular tweak. That mod was just a bag of random things, because I never really thought about packaging it up for the public. \n<br />\n<br />I was just playing around with it, releasing them as I made them. However, I want to make all of the tweaks to be easier to find by the public, and as such decided to seperate them and give them better descriptive names.\n<br />\n<br />For instance, if someone was looking for a mod to feed rabbits, they couldn't find the tweak that I made, since it was part of \"Andrealphus Gameplay Tweaks\". However, now I hope it's easier to find them. My apologies for any inconvenience."
