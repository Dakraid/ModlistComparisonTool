nexusDescription=Have you ever wondered how everyone in Skyrim can speak perfectly through mouthfuls of bread and mead? Well you wont have to anymore with this incredibly simple fix. I simply put conditions on the sitting/standing eating and drinking animations to not play while in dialogue with the player. They will still hold on to whatever they're eating but wont take a bite until you leave.\n<br />\n<br />Thought I might as well put this up on SE
