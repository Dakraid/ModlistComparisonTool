If you have already sold that armor or weapon, you will neither be able to complete nor fail [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Buy_Dwarven_artifact]the quest[/url] until you obtain the exact item again. Good luck finding another Dwarven Bow of Freezing or some similar rare enchanted item.\n<br />\n<br />This mod makes it so you can tell Calcelmo that you won't sell him the item, even if you don't have it. You can also tell him to never bother you about your Dwemer purchases again.\n<br />\n<br />[center][youtube]1KehIlajLG8[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Gain ability to tell Calcelmo that you won't sell him the Dwemer item he's attempting to buy without actually having the item.\n<br />[*]Gain ability to tell Calcelmo to never bother you about your Dwemer purchases again\n<br />[*]ESL\n<br />[*]Voice acted\n<br />[/list]\n<br />If you want the quest to trigger again in the future after telling Calcelmo to stop bothering you, use the follow console command:\n<br />[quote]\xfeffset CalcelmoFuckOffGlobal to 0[/quote]\n<br />[b]Installation/Uninstallation/Upgrade[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Whenever.
