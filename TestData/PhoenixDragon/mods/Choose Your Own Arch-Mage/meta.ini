You may ask anyone to take up the role, even apprentices, though not all will accept.  You may make this decision immediately, or after a long tenure leading the College.  It's up to you.  Choose wisely; once you've selected your successor, there is no going back.\n<br />\n<br />[quote][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/23217/23217-1576999977-1143957329.png[/img]\n<br />\x25aa Once you're made Arch-Mage, all members of the college will be given new dialog options to allow you to discuss their interest in the role.  Some will accept at once, some may need some convincing, and some will flat out refuse.\n<br />\x25aa The selected Arch-Mage will don their own Arch-Mage robes and receive a key.  You may keep your set.\n<br />\x25aa The new Arch-Mage will have their schedule modified.\n<br />\x25aa Many of the greetings which discuss storyline events but have nothing to do with your rank have been reconditioned to check the questline status, so they will still play after you're relinquished the rank of Arch-Mage. \n<br />\x25aa Dialog for the quest \"Aftershock\" has been edited to remove mention of your rank.\n<br />\x25aa If you're using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514]Obscure's College of Winterhold[/url] (v1.5 and higher), the Arch-Mage of your choice will select one of the six variations for the Arch-Mage's quarters.  Additionally, their old room will be converted to a guest room.[/quote]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/23217/23217-1549521938-2067913036.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />This mod can be installed before you're Arch-Mage, or when you're Arch-Mage.\xa0 Mod Organizer 2 or Vortex are recommended to install.  All plugins are in the ESP-FE format.  While technically possible to uninstall at any time, uninstalling a mod is never recommended after you've saved your game with it installed.\xa0 If you're running a very big load order, Choose Your Own Arch-Mage may be flagged as a master file.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Recommendations:[/b]\n<br />  \x25aa This mod was designed to be used with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514]Obscure's College of Winterhold[/url] (v1.5 and higher).  This will unlock all of the mod's features.\n<br />\x25aa The\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch[/url]\xa0\x66or all of the fixes it provides.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Patches Offered For:[/b]\n<br />  \x25aa At this time, I have yet to find a conflict in need of patching.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Load Order:\n<br />[/b]\x25aa\xa0\x43YA should be loaded after [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22184]Improved College Entry[/url].\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />Not Compatible With:[/b]\n<br />  \x25aa [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17004]Immersive College of Winterhold[/url] has its own role relinquishment setup.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/23217/23217-1549442011-1936887053.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/23217/23217-1549441199-1000897259.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Does your choice have an impact on story or gameplay?[/b]\n<br />Presently, no. I am open to ideas on [i]simple[/i] ways to do this.  I want to avoid over-scoping.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Can I take the Arch-Mage position back if I want to?[/b]\n<br />No, you won't be able to.  You gave away the role!  You can't just ask for it back.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Why did you allow X to accept the position but not Y?[/b]\n<br />It was simply more fun to have certain characters say no!  I picked them based on their personalities and who would either make a great Arch-Mage or a terrible one.  Most options who I felt would make a boring Arch-Mage tell you no.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/23217/23217-1549442011-1936887053.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br

[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194]Mod Organizer 2[/url]'s virtual file system to keep my workspace organized, and backup/restore features to let me experiment wildly.\n<br

various formats.\n<br />\x25aa I use [url=https://www.audacityteam.org]Audacity[/url] to edit existing dialogue lines into new ones.\n<br />\x25aa [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17765]Yakitori Audio Converter[/url] gets the new lines ready to use after they've been edited and lip files generated.\n<br />\x25aa The
