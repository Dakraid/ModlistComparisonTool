nexusDescription="[size=5]What is this mod? What does it do?[/size]\n<br />\n<br />   \xfeffThis is a .tri (morph) replacer for expression morphs made for High Poly Head. Designed to fully move the face while playing expressions; sometimes including the eyes, brows, teeth and to be more natural-looking facial expressions, eye movement and mouth movement while speaking for NPCs and the player, whenever they use high poly head. \n<br />\n<br />[size=5]How can I use this mod?[/size]\n<br />\n<br />   \xfeff-You might want to pair this with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70883]Random Emotions[/url]\xfeff and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11669]Mfg Fix[/url]\xfeff. You don't need the patch for random emotions; that's on Mfg Fix's mod page, but if it works for you, you might want to keep it. I just didn't. Looks like this:\n<br />\n<br />[center][youtube]mJSDnY03gdg[/youtube]\n<br />[youtube]WmRD6u3UZqk[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />   \xfeff-Or if you like to precisely manipulate the expressions I recommend [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12919]Mfg Command[/url]\xfeff. Don't use this mod with Random Emotions and Mfg Fix. You'll get face flickering and eventually your game will crash. (Speaking from experience).\n<br />\n<br />   -If you are using Poser Hotkeys Plus or anything that overwrites scripts of the above mentioned mods, you should let mfg fix and random emotions or mfg command overwrite it. \n<br />\n<br />   \xfeff-To see what expressions are effecting your character you may need [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250]More Informative Console[/url] overwriting your other mods. To use it, you open up console while your character is visible in third person and left click on them. It needs to say the NPC's name or Player. Then you press TAB key bunch of times till the expression information (MFG) appears. Then you can use commands like mfg expression, mfg modifier, mfg phoneme; look for the number of whichever you want to modify and type the power of the expression. \n<br />\n<br />*As in example; you want to make your character look happy. You opened console, clicked on your character, it said 'player' on console. You pressed tab bunch of times till mfg appeared. You find Dialogue Happy or Mood happy and you type \"mfg expression 2 100\" for Dialogue Happy 100 Power, or \"mfg expression 10 100\" for Mood Happy.\n<br />\n<br />*To reset the expressions, you need to select the NPC or player and type \"mfg reset\" to reset all of the animation morphing to 0.\n<br />\n<br />   \xfeff-A good guide and pictures can be found [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=187155077]here[/url]. It's a steam guide to facial expressions, if I wasn't clear enough. They are not made with my animations (morphs) in pictures, but the commands are the same. \n<br />\n<br />   \xfeff-You can use these mods in combination with Face Menu and FaceEdit Menu in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17743]Poser Hotkeys Plus[/url]\xfeff (You might need to bind a hotkey to the menus first inside MCM). Mixing mfg command and mfg fix isn't a good idea, try one or the other. Don't use mfg command with Random Emotions as well, since it makes your face flicker and eventually your game crashes. \n<br />\n<br />   \xfeff-Old face presets made for High Poly Head Expressions still work with this mod, but you might need to make new ones, since no one has made presets for this mod yet and they may look odd.\n<br />\n<br />   \xfeff-You can use the \"Expressions\" tab on racemenu to use the morphs on your character preset to make them permanent as well. Be careful using these, since they can break over 1.00, causing clipping.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Possible Future Updates and Changes\n<br />[/size]\n<br />   \xfeffI may end up changing a few of the phoneme morphs. I see a couple ended up more exaggerated than other ones. Please be patient. You can always point out something I missed out or overlooked. I'll do my best fixing/modifying them. \n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Mods needed to work properly:[/size]\n<br />\n<br />*[url=https://vectorplexis.com/files/file/283-high-poly-head]High Poly Head 1.4[/url] (For head mesh and Brows)\n<br />*[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19181]Expressive Facial Animation[/url] (For Teeth Mesh)\n<br />*I use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49996]Ultimate Eyes[/url], but I don't think they are a hard requirement. If anything looks broken with the eyes, you might want to switch over to that one.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Credits\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[url=https://vectorplexis.com/profile/90-kouleifoh/]KouLeifou[/url] for [url=https://vectorplexis.com/files/file/283-high-poly-head]High Poly Head 1.4[/url] \n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201]Bodyslide and Outfit Studio[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4291759]ousnius[/url] (Program used to modify the .tri files)\n<br />[url=https://twitter.com/Gale3DArt]Gale[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/76076198]r1goodwin[/url] for helping me with testing the mod.\n<br />[url=https://twitter.com/Gale3DArt]Gale[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/1005940]wammy[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/76076198]r1goodwin[/url] and [url=https://twitter.com/insxsni]zephy[/url] for providing screens."
