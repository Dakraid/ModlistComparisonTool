nexusDescription="[size=5][b]Sexy[/b]\n<br />[i]adjective[/i]\n<br />comparative adjective: [b]sexier[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Informal\n<br />[/list]     exciting; appealing.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\xfeff[size=4]An ongoing project to incorporate select Creation Club content into the base game. By default, Bethesda's Creation Club mods are highly modular and compatible, relying on scripts and isolated quests to introduce content. This modular structure comes at the cost of mediocre integration and low quality quests that allow players to acquire high-level equipment far before they should. While this adherence to modular integration was acceptable before Anniversary Edition, as Bethesda had no way of knowing which combinations of Creations players would use, now all Creations can be easily bought in one package. This series of mods will sacrifice Bethesda's modular format in order to further and better incorporate that content into the game.\n<br />\n<br />More detailed information regarding each release can be found under the Articles tab.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4307]Release One: Creation Club Armors[/url][/size][/center]\n<br />[i]     \"Despite the climate and people of the Frozen North, many traders and merchants of the Imperial Provence often find themselves doing business with the Nords of Skyrim. As such, seeing one of the land's native barbarians or warriors wearing an errant piece of steel or iron forged in the Heartlands is hardly a surprise, uncommon as it may be. The ushering of the Fourth Era and the defeat of Dagon's forces at the hand of Emperor Martin Septim has seen Imperial culture celebrated all across the Empire, with the north being no exception. Even to the northeast, in the lands of ash and ruin, one can still find Cyrodiilic craftsmanship among the elves' exotic leathers and hide.\"[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4308]Release Two: Civil War Champions[/url][/size][/center]\n<br />[i]     \"The Nords are characterized as steadfast and stubborn; their attempted 'secession' proves this true even to a fault. The traitors fashion their armor after the 'bear', a local fauna with which one of their kings shares a name. Truly a waste of their people's natural artistic talent when it comes to metalworking and smithing.\"[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[i]     \"Many of you are too young to remember The Great War, and the then proud Legionnaires bathed in shining steel. And for those who are too young, those who we fought and died for in hope of freedom\x2014who now must bravely fight and die in honor\x2014\x61re too young to remember the sight of the Legate. They are their generals, and your target. You will see them and you will know what they are. They cover themselves head-to-toe in Ebony, mined from our soil and our home. You will see their dark figure in the snow, and you will know that they stand in opposition of our land, our people. You will not see their face, as in spite of their 'treaties' with the elves the still wear the face of the Ninth! Yes! The same face they use on their gold, the face of Talos, they use to protect themselves from us! When your steel pierces their flesh, you will see they are but cowards! They may cover themselves in the blood of the Nine all they wish, for they still bleed as red as any man. You will see the face they deny us, and the liar that lies beneath!\"[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4309]Release Three: Nordic Jewelry[/url][/size][/center]\n<br />[i]    \"Impressive, isn't it? No, no, I see that look in your eye, but I assure you, my esteemed customer, that this is the genuine article! Authentic Nordic craftsmanship, probably mid-Third Era by the looks of it, definitely before the Crisis. How can I tell? Why don't I answer you question by asking one of my own; how many snowbacks to you see running around casting spells after that business with the College?\xa0 No Nords born in the Fourth Era give a damn about Magicka Restoration! I tell you, the real 'clevermen' is anyone who realizes by prices are the best in the Hold!\"[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][center]Supplemental Mods[/center][/size]\xfeffThe following mods are either similar in scope to Sexier Vanilla or will work very well along side it.[list]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67019]Ghosts of the Tribunal - Reduced Cut\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66676]The Cause - Reduced Cut[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66864]\n<br />Catir Club - Immersive Creation Club Integration[/url][/list]"
