nexusDescription="Hello! Earlier this year, I started on a small project with the goal to retexture Kaidan's armor in order to bring it up to an HD standard for use alongside other HD mods. I reached out to\xa0[url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/571605-cabal120/]CaBaL120[/url]\xa0\x66or permission wondering back in May and got the green light to use some of their assets from the aMidianborn series. You can find the original mods [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45692]here[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41731]here[/url]. As for the rest of the assets used, the portions of the vampire armor were done by [url=https://sforzmods.tumblr.com/]sforzinda[/url] over on tumblr ([url=https://sforzmods.tumblr.com/perms]open permissions[/url]). You can find their original work [url=https://sforzmods.tumblr.com/sse_variations]here[/url]. &lt;3\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f9cb9c][size=5]What's Covered?[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />After spending many hours hunting for the decals originally used in the original design, I finally landed on two of the three needed to complete the set. I managed to find the [b]tiger[/b] and [b]dragon[/b] decals, however had trouble finding an exact replica of the [b]wolf[/b] variation, so as of now that set is blank. It's still HD, however, there is no additional decal on top. Each portion of his armor has been covered; including the boots and gloves.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />All textures are either [b]2K[/b] or [b]less[/b].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Both sets for the available masculine and feminine frames are retextured![/b] However, there is one catch.\xa0If Kaidan wears his armor, as usual, he will have the original tiger decal present on his upper chest area. If your character equips his armor and happens to have a feminine frame, the armor will NOT have the tiger decal on it. [b]This is purposeful[/b] as I could not for the life of me concave the design to match the original, as the decals need to be contorted in order to fit properly\xa0over the bust area.\n<br />\n<br /> [i]** If anyone wants to take a crack at modifying the decal for the feminine set, please do so and let me know your results! **[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f9cb9c][size=5]Recommendations?\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23738]Pandorable's Kaidan Replacer\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44905]Kaidan 2 Katana Replacer[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59349]Kaidan 2 Follower Voice Fixes and Additional Dialogue[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49433]Kaidan 2 Follow Distance Fix[/url]\n<br />\n<br />All assets belong to their respective artists!
