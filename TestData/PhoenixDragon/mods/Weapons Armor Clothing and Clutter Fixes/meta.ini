If you wish to use one of the optional texture resolutions, install it after the main file and allow it to replace the original .bsa file.\n<br />If you are using a Bashed Patch, then you will need to use the [b]WACCF_BashedPatchLvlListFix.esp[/b] file, as explained below.  If you are not using a Bashed Patch, then you can delete this file. If you are adding WACCF to an existing game, please ensure prior to installation that you are not wearing the Archmage's Robes (unequip them, if necessary).\n<br />\n<br />[b]WACCF_BashedPatchLvlListFix.esp[/b] contains a copy of the leveled list edits from WACCF and is basically a \"helper\" file for creating a Bashed Patch.\xa0 The reason for this is that the Bashed Patch doesn't do a great job at combining the type of edits that WACCF makes to the leveled lists.\xa0 Often, if you have another mod that edits the same leveled list, the Bashed Patch will end up reverting the leveled list changes from WACCF.\xa0 By loading this helper file last, it will help to ensure your Bashed Patch contains the correct edits.  However, the good news is that when you build your Bashed Patch, Wrye Bash will merge this file into the Bashed Patch, meaning that [i]it won't actually take up an additional plugin slot[/i].  After creating your Bashed Patch, this plugin can be disabled.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][color=#cccccc][size=4] [size=5]U[/size]PDATING[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />Version 2.0 edits certain containers in Jorrvaskr, the College of Winterhold, the Ragged Flagon Cistern, Fort Dawnguard, and Volkihar Keep.  Any items stored in these containers prior to updating should still be present in those containers after installing the update. However, as always, it is strongly advised that you make a backup of your save prior to updating this mod.\n<br />\n<br />Version 2.1 just makes a few small edits to the plugin.\xa0 I don't foresee any issues with updating\xa0\x66rom v2.0 to this version\xa0mid-game.\xa0 There were no changes to any of the textures or other assets, so you can continue to use the v2.0 texture options with the v2.1 update.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][color=#cccccc][size=4] [size=5]U[/size]NINSTALLING[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />Please be aware that it is never recommended to uninstall a mod mid-game.

Some changes are straight-forward bug fixes.  These are things that are obviously wrong, such as shoes that have the ClothingBody keyword instead of the ClothingFeet keyword, a weapon that has the wrong\xa0\x62\x61sh/block data,\xa0or an item that's using the wrong mesh or texture.\xa0  The second type of change is slightly more subjective and was made to improve consistency and balance between different items.  Weapons and armor types were designed to scale in a particular way, and some items rather obviously break from that established pattern.  This mod attempts to bring these wayward items into line with the normal progression of value, weight, damage, speed, and other properties.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/609]Click here to see a more detailed list of the types of changes included in this mod.[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][color=#cccccc][size=4][size=5]C[/size]ONSISTENCY[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />Beyond straight-up bug fixes, this mod also changes the value and properties of some items so that they conform better to established patterns of progression among different item and material types.\xa0 Many of these changes are fairly obvious when looking at a list of item stats.\xa0\xa0[url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-O70ou2o9aH1zQzgdBvWjo1NevnM--YnTwhBCDxk3Eg/edit?usp=sharing]This spreadsheet lists many of the changes this mod makes to weapon and armor stats.[/url]\xfeff\xa0 Certain items were also renamed for great consistency and to allow for better inventory sorting.  Finally, there were a few changes that I felt were consistent with the appearance and/or lore of the item, but did not strictly conform to the vanilla conventions, such as making the spectral Drainblood weapons silent.  While these changes are subjective and were personal choices on my part, I felt they were justified given the nature and/or established lore of the item.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][color=#cccccc][size=4][size=5]B[/size]ALANCE[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />Some of the changes made by this mod were meant to improve the balance of the game, and do have a slight effect on gameplay.\xa0 For example,\xa0the speed and trajectory of arrows and bolts has been modified to make archery feel more realistic and aiming more natural.\xa0 All hooded robes have been removed from the game and replaced with separate robes and hoods, allowing for more diversity in equipping and enchanting those items.\xa0 The dragon priest masks were also modified to better balance them with other gameplay options, and weapon progression has been modified to align with armor progression and the arrangement of the perk tree.
