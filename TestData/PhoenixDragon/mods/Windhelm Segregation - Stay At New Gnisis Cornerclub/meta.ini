nexusDescription="Elda Early-Dawn will now decline to rent a room at Candlehearth Hall to you if you are playing as a Dark Elf. If you need a place to stay in Windhelm, Ambarys Rendar at the New Gnisis Cornerclub is willing to rent you the bed upstairs (where Malthyr Elenil usually sleeps).\n<br />\n<br />Nils is not affected, so if something were to happen to Elda and Nils would take over, it will be available to Dark Elves as normal.\n<br />\n<br />If Malthyr has to take over for Ambarys, he will continue to offer the bed rental service to Dark Elves."
