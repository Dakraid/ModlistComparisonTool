nexusDescription="This mod afflicts the player with a severe disease when they try to releasing Serana, when the player is not a vampire (or werewolf).\n<br />[color=#e06666][b]\n<br />Disclaimer: These tweaks are provided as is. I WON'T be making any patches, other versions, merges and/or other requests. If you yourself want to change/tweak anything or make a patch, feel free to do so. (see permissions!)\n<br />\n<br />I won't make any ports for consoles or Bethesda.net myself, but I do allow others to do so. (see permissions!)\n<br />[/b][/color][color=#76a5af][b]\n<br />LE version can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/98280]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />SE version can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26852]here[/url].\n<br />[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />At a certain point during the [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Awakening]Awakening[/url] quest in the dawnguard questline, you'll come across Serana's tomb in Dimhollow Crypt.\n<br />\n<br />When you activate the button of her sarcophagus, causing your hand to be impaled. Yet, in Vanilla, this has no consequences. So I decided to add one: \"the Corrupted Blood Curse\".\n<br />\n<br />The Corrupted Blood Curse is inspired by the Decaying status effect from Divinity: Original Sin 2 and has similar effects: You will no longer regen health and healing spells and items will cause damage instead.\n<br />\n<br />For compatibility issues, when the player is a werewolf, they will also be immune to the Curse.\n<br />\n<br />If you contract the Curse and become a vampire or werewolf later on, the Curse will be removed as well.\n<br />\n<br />If you are neither a werewolf, nor a vampire while you press the button, Disease Resistance is taken into account. By doing the math, you'll have a smaller chance depending how high your resistance is. For instance, if you have 75% Disease Resistance, you'll only have a 25% to catch the disease.\n<br />\n<br />It can be cured like any disease in Vanilla, though. (Potion of Cure Disease or praying at a shrine)\n<br />\n<br />More information on the DOS2 inspiration: \n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]In the [url=https://divinityoriginalsin2.wiki.fextralife.com/Decrepit+Ruins]Decrepit Ruins[/url], you'll meet a Magister that have been afflicted with a \"blood curse\" after trying to open a cursed lever, without any knowledge of what their dealing with.\n<br />\n<br />I felt like the player (when being a non-vampire) is in a similar situation when pressing the button on Serana's Sarcophagus: meddling in affairs above their head.[/spoiler]"
