The priests are gone, but the hall lives on.\"[/size][/center][/i]\n<br />[center]\n<br />Wuth Rein is\xa0my very first mod, so I kept it small, reasonable, and clean. I tried to focus on quality, rather than quantity. \n<br />This is a tiny and cosy place, primarly designed for mages and scholars.[/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[b]\x2a64\xa0\x46\x65\x61tures\xa0\x2a65[/b]\n<br />\x2022 Wuth Rein\xa0is a restored nordic ruin, and sticks to this theme in a lore-friendly way.\n<br />\x2022 It has all crafting stations.\n<br />\x2022 All storage is safe, from chests to bookshelves - and even nordic urns !\n<br />\x2022 Fully navmeshed.\n<br />\x2022 Room for one follower near the entrance.\n<br />\x2022 Your spouse can move in.\n<br />\x2022 It features a small healing fountain, which will cure diseases.\n<br />[b]\n<br />\x2a64\xa0Getting there\xa0\x2a65[/b]\n<br />Wuth Rein can be accessed from the banks of the White River, not too far from the Ritual Stone. It will be marked as undiscovered on your map by default anyway. To get in, you need to find the previous owner, who's fate took a grim turn.\xa0Once you've located him, you'll find the key and a journal, which will tell you a bit more about the story behind Wuth Rein. It's not a quest and it shouldn't take much time. Look around. Something should catch your eye on the opposite bank of the river.\n<br />[b]\n<br />\x2a64\xa0Q&amp;A\xa0\x2a65[/b]\n<br />Q : Is this mod compatible with...\n<br />A : Unless you're using a mod that adds something PRECISELY where the entrance to Wuth Rein is, you should be fine.\n<br />\n<br />Q : Does Wuth Rein require...\n<br />A : Wuth Rein is pure standalone, and doensn't even require DLCs.\n<br />\n<br />Q : Will you add mannequins and weapon racks????????\n<br />A : No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Q : I can't find the old owner !!!\n<br />A : [size=1]Turn around, you'll see a stone cairn with a flag. It's there. It's litteraly there. There's a flag. Just get to the flag.[/size]\n<br />[b]\n<br />\x2a64\xa0Special Thanks\xa0\x2a65[/b]\n<br />\x2022 [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/31380350?tab=about+me]Rosehla[/url], for the incredibely detailed and spontaneous help on the last update.
