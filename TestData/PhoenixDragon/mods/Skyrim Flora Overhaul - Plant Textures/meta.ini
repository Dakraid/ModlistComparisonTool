Even on PC this can be a really demanding mod, xbox would likely need a less demanding version. 2) I am not comfortable leaving the mod in the hands of someone else. I prefer full control myself to e.g patch, remove stuff i'm not happy with etc. 3) I am currently not very satisfied with the mod overall, so obviously i'm not interested in it being ported either. Thanks for understanding and thanks for not PM'ing me about it.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Q: The LOD's in the distance look like they have been scissored in half?!\n<br />A: You have a LOD that isn't compatible with my MOD which comes with it's own LOD for trees. So make sure you have no other mod(s) that is adding a tree LOD which overrides mine. This is the location for the tree LOD file: [i]...&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim Special Edition&#92;Data&#92;Textures&#92;terrain&#92;tamriel&#92;trees[/i]\xa0make sure this file is the same as in the archive. If not you can extract the file from the SFO archive and overwrite the file in this folder.\n<br />\n<br />Q: The Grass is really tiny / it's less grass than vanilla!\n<br />A: Make sure you haven't done any \"strange\" edits to your ini files. If you are using MO 2 as your mod organizer it has its own .ini files, make sure they are edited correctly. Also, both Skyrim.ini and skyrimprefs.ini can both be deleted from your [i]my documents/my games/skyrim special edition[/i]\xa0\x66older and the game will create new ones from scratch, this can often be helpful in these situations.\n<br />\n<br />Q: What is the performance impact?\n<br />A: Quite big. Depending on the area it gives me -1 to -10 less FPS. (Nvidia 980ti, i7 @4.7GHz). \n<br />Avoid this mod if you are struggling with FPS already. However performance can change in the future, check back again :)\n<br />\n<br />Q: The mod doesn't install, it gets stuck in NMM!\n<br />A: Some things that might help are: disable real-time antivirus, run NMM as Admin, restart NMM, download and install the mod manually: (\xa0https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/2154-0-1478104091.jpg )\n<br />\n<br />Q: The grass in the tundra is not tall, can you change it?\n<br />A: No, it's a tundra, it's supposed to look like that. Use google, search for fall tundra.\n<br />\n<br />Q: The trees are shaking, why?\n<br />A: WInd animations. They are not perfect and difficult to tweak.\n<br />\n<br />Q: The grass cuts in a line where it goes from lush to no grass, any fix?\n<br />A:\xa0If you have a line in the .ini that says \"IGrassCellRadius=2\" (or similar) delete it.\n<br />\n<br />Q: There's a bug where flora (lupins, some bushes) sometimes disappears from the screen when you look up or when they reach the sides of the screen.\n<br />A: Yes. There is no fix for this, a problem with the engine it seems. It's nothing too serious since it doesnt happen very often.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is this mod \"4K\"?\n<br />A: No. Textures range from 512x512 to 4096x4096, it will depend on the texture.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Q: what should i install? Everything in downloads?\n<br />A: \"main files\" are the stand-alone mods, they can not be mixed together. Other files are patches or addons, so no you dont need them, but i would recommend to use files in \"updates\".\n<br />\n<br />Q:\xa0How can i get more dense grass? / How can i get better performance?\n<br />A1: You edit the iMinGrassSize value in skyrim flora overhaul.ini (in data). A value of 10 will give you very dense grass at the cost of performance, higher values means less grass and better performance. iMinGrassSize=50 will give low-end computer a FPS boost but the grasses will be rather \"patchy\".\xa0\n<br />A2: You might want to change Shadow Quality to High instead of Ultra, this mod is particularly taxing with shadows since each tree branch will cast a shadow. Some users have reported a whole 30 FPS increase with turning it to \"high\".\n<br />A3: Use 2K textures under \"optional files\".\n<br />\n<br />Q: I uninstalled it, now have purple trees!\n<br />A: Delete the trees folder (\xa0&#92;Data&#92;Meshes&#92;Landscape&#92;Trees)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][b][color=#e06666]Other mods i've made that you might enjoy:[/color][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24957]\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][u]Summer Edition II[/u][/color][/url][/b][color=#6d9eeb][u]\xa0[/u][/color]\n<br />[b][color=#6fa8dc][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8306][u]Bent Pines II[/u][/url][/color][/b][/size][/b]"
