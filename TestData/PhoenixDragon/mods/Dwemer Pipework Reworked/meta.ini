nexusDescription="[b][color=#dd7e6b]Rework of Dwemer pipes, including Dwemer boilers.[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Dwemer pipes are supposedly used as a ventilation and a heating system - now they really are. Before there were fake exhaust holes drawed on the pipes, now these holes are real. Reworked meshes to have transparency and made them double-sided. Added animated fans inside, increased metal glossiness.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />I also made Dwemer boilers look like they are really working, heated to the glowing. (Looks really good with ENB - the glow shines on the surroundings, adding realism)\n<br />\n<br />I did not include any textures with the first version - this way the mod is compatible with every texture mod.\xa0Textures are included from the second version.\n<br />\n<br />First version is compatible with everything (except the mods that change the same meshes - currently none that I know of)\n<br />Second version is compatible with everything, except the mods that change textures of Dwemer pipes and boilers. (some\xa0inconsistencies are to be expected)\n<br />\n<br />If someone wants to use another Dwemer texture with this mod, then first version is 100% compatible, second version must overwrite all the other textures or there will be stuff missing.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />No esp - does not take away place in mod list.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Version 4 is out - read the change log.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Skyrim LE version:\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/106895]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/106895[/url]"
