nexusDescription="While checking the rocks in Blackreach from another I mod I noticed the crystals there did not look very good.\xa0 I decided to try to change that and make them more crystal like, and while doing so I noticed the texture they used was actually from something else.\xa0 So I changed a lot about the meshes and textures related to both the Azura Crystals and the Blackreach Crystals to hopefully make them both look better and maybe a little more unique.\xa0 I tried to retain the light outer glow on the Azura Crystals and make the Blackreach Crystals have a better glow, both up close and at a distance.\n<br />\n<br />Big credits to Brumbek and SMIM whose Blackreach Crystal meshes were used as the base before adding in the multilayer parallax."
