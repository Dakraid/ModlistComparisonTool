nexusDescription="[size=3]A plugin replacers for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6817]KS Hairdos[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31300]KS Hairdos HDT SMP[/url] mods to make choosing your hair style a little bit easier. Was made, because other replacers for KS Hairdos were a bit too light or too big, while still having hair I did not like, meanwhile KS Hairdos HDT SMP didn't have any replacers at all even though it offers 100 new hairstyles.\n<br />\n<br />KS Hairdos plugin consists of approximately 20 both short and long, sophisticated and everyday hair styles for women and approximately 15 hair styles for men, while the version with hair physics - approximately 10 of them. In your game you will find hair without any kind of too eye-catching accessories like big ribbons, hats and flowers and hair which feel right to be in Skyrim without them looking too cartoonish. Mainly oriented to be immersive, while adding a little bit of spice to our characters. Each one of these should also not clip through armour and circlets or clip only a little bit.\n<br />\n<br />Each version requires the main mod for all the textures and meshes. To use the replacers, just load them right after the original mods in your mod order. Of course, they can be used together or separately as replacers were made for two separate mods.\n<br />\n<br />Screenshots were made to demonstrate some of the hair included and that they won't clip at all or just a little bit. You can also see [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44975]KS Hairdos 1.7 Salt and Wind[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52336]KS Hairdos 1.8 Salt and Wind[/url] textures on them. Also these characters are using high poly head, so the hair should look fine for both not high poly and high poly users.\n<br />[/size]"
