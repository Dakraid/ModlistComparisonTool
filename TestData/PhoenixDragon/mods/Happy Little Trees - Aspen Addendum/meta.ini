nexusDescription="[b][u][size=5][i]Happy Little Trees - Aspen Addendum[/i][/size][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50961]Happy Little Trees[/url] uses a custom texture path for the bark of its aspen trees. Because of that, some meshes left untouched by the mod (most notably fallen aspen trees and stumps) still use the vanilla textures, which leads to a bit of inconsistency.\n<br />\n<br />This simple texture replacer gives the vanilla aspen bark a HLT-style makeover, effectively fixing that problem. I've also recolored the branches used by these vanilla meshes, giving them a much darker look that better matches the reddish-brown branches of HLT's aspens.\n<br />\n<br />One extra note- the vanilla bark texture is also used by the aspen trees in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917]Beyond Skyrim - Bruma[/url]\xfeff, so it'll improve consistency a bit there as well."
