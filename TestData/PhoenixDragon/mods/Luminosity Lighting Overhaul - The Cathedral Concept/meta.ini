Luminosity is meant for gameplay and immersion. Light bounces off the environment to fill space, so don't expect pitch black dungeons. This mod preserves the vanilla light sign posting which is meant to help guide you through interiors and dramatize the scene by putting special emphasis on the creators art. Furthermore, it is all built on a single set of imagespace settings (ie contrast, brightness, saturation), making it an ideal interior lighting mod for ENB creation as it offers phenomenal consistency. If you also use Cathedral Weathers, there is a power to adjust interior brightness to your liking.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Versions 1, 2, and 3 do not move or add new bulbs, which makes these versions ultralight and highly compatible.\n<br />[*]Recommended to overwrite Relighting Skyrim for its bulbs.\xa0\n<br />[*]Recommended to use Cathedral Wealthers to customize interior brightness levels.\n<br />[/list][size=5][img]https://i.imgur.com/ok3ktHv.png[/img][/size]\n<br />[size=5][b][center][b][b]Compatibility\n<br />[/b][/b][/center][/b][/size][img]https://i.imgur.com/ok3ktHv.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />This mod solely overwrites vanilla records; Cell, Light, Lighting Template, (Interior) Weather. For this reason, it's technically\xa0\x63ompatible with any mod that is compatible with Skyrim. However, in order for you to appreciate the changes that this mod makes, it should be loaded after all other mods, unless the mod in question specifically says to load after lighting mods. For example, mods that modify specific lighting, such as torch, magelight, or spell illumination should be loaded after.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]Sample Load Order:[/b]\n<br />-Skyrim.esm\n<br />-Update.esm\n<br />-Dawnguard.esm\n<br />-Hearthfires.esm\n<br />-Dragonborn.esm\n<br />-Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp\n<br />-Other Mods, such as Cathedral Weathers.esp\n<br />-Relighting Skyrim.esp\n<br />-Luminosity - Lightweight Lighting.esp\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/ok3ktHv.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />1.
