nexusDescription="[color=#ff7700][size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />There is no lock picking mini-game. If you try to open a locked object it will automatically pick the lock for you. It will take a certain amount of lock picks from your inventory to do so. If you don't have enough lock picks you can't pick the lock. The amount of lock picks taken can be configured.\n<br />\n<br />If you have the skeleton key you will be able to pick any lock immediately without requiring any other lock picks.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][b]Requirements[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21294].NET Script Framework[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][b]Installing[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Make sure the framework above is installed properly.\n<br />\n<br />Install this mod with a mod manager or manually. The DLL file from this mod should go here:\n<br />[b]Data/NetScriptFramework/Plugins/[/b]\n<br />\n<br />It should be safe to install or uninstall mid-playthrough since this mod does not touch save-games in any way.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][b]Uninstalling[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Uninstall with your mod manager or remove the DLL file from above path.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][b]Configuration[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The configuration file is in /Data/NetScriptFramework/Plugins/NoLockPicking.config.txt and you can change these options:\n<br />SuperCheatMode = False - Never require any lock picks at all. Set true if you want to enable this setting.\n<br />LockPickCostRelativeVeryEasy = 0.1\n<br />LockPickCostRelativeEasy = 0.3\n<br />LockPickCostRelativeMedium = 0.9\n<br />LockPickCostRelativeHard = 2\n<br />LockPickCostRelativeVeryHard = 5\n<br />The above settings control the amount of lock picks taken on average based on the difficulty of the lock compared to your skill level. For example if you try to pick a difficult lock but your skill is 70 it will probably fall into the \"medium\" category here and you will use 0.9 lock picks on average (90% chance to use up a lock pick). You can also set values like 1.5 for example to take 1 lock pick and 50% chance to take a second lock pick.\n<br />BonusReducesPickUsage = True - This will cause bonus effects to reduce the amount of picks used. For example +20% easier lock picking enchantment/perk will take (x / 1.2) of actual picks. It will reduce the amount of picks you use on average.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][b]Credits[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/559752]KitsuneOuka[/url] - Helping with testing."
