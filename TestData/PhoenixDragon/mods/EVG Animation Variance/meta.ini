Remove any idles if you want the repurposed ones to work.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffe599]Random Idles/Sexy Move[/color]: Will have priority over this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b6d7a8]EVG Conditional Idles[/color]: are you serious\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b6d7a8]cookeh's conditional and random idles[/color]: Yes.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffe599]Torch Module[/color]:\n<br />Compatible with new torch types (Everlight) and torch replacers (Medieval Torches.) Proper torch wield will look funny with Tilted away, but is still compatible. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]Custom Racial Animation Path[/color]: The priority numbers for that mod were set very high, will need personal tweaking based on your DAR mods. hehe C.R.A.P\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />FAQ\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />Why is this not a part of Conditional Idles?\n<br />I don't know. This is more about spicing up vanilla, making it not look so samey- think of it like trying to make a badly tiled texture look better. There's potential, you just need to tweak it a little. Conditional Idles is more like adding new things or new animations to explore, also uses other mods as hooks to add content. This is staying vanilla. probably.\n<br />\n<br />Folder numbers so I can edit your mod?\n<br />702: Tilted away\n<br />704: Higher\n<br />706: Overhead\n<br />\n<br />708: 1st person Tilted\n<br />710: 1st person Higher\n<br />712: 1st person Overhead\n<br />\n<br />-1714: Idle Variants 1\n<br />-1716: Idle Variants 2\n<br />\n<br />-310: Elder Animations\n<br />-314: Child Animations\n<br />-316: Young Female Animations\n<br />-318: Imperial/Penitus Animations\n<br />-320: Egoistic Animations\n<br />\n<br />-350: Optional NPC type to player animations\n<br />\n<br />-420: Alternate Wounded\n<br />-424: Smooth Floating Animations\n<br />-426: Alternate Laying Down\n<br />\n<br />Script Lag?\n<br />No. Thank and endorse Felisky for DAR.\n<br />\n<br />What mods are you using in the video/screenshots?\n<br />Final 20 seconds of the video shows a quick list of everything character wise. My nexus profile bio shows other things.[/left]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/44449/44449-1646947711-672090167.png[/img]\n<br />[quote]\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]Torch - NPC, Player[/color]\n<br />There are several ways to hold a torch. They may not all be optimal or safe, but hey- can't expect everyone to know.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]Vanilla[/color] - 1/3 chance\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]Higher[/color] - 1/3 chance\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]Tilted away[/color] - 1/3 chance\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]Higher, tilted overhead[/color] - possible when indoors\n<br />Chances become 1/4 when indoors.\n<br />\n<br />Choosing the modular installation will also let you completely replace the torch animation with one of mine without DAR, if you'd like.\n<br />[b]Update 1.1:[/b] 1st person animations now available. They do not sync when switching, however.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]Personality - NPC, Optionally Player[/color]\n<br />Small tweaks or new animations based an NPC's voice type, race or faction. You can toggle each individually in the installer.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]Children, Unisex[/color] - Neutral posture &amp; arm position - forward walk, run\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]Feminine[/color] - Lifted wrists, bent elbows, arched back - forward walk, run, sitting \n<br />(YoungEagerFemale voice type ex. Camilla, Ysolda- very subtle.)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]Haafingar Officials[/color] - Unisex: 25% chance for new idle \n<br />(Imperial Guards, Solitude Guards, Penitus Oculatus. Must be in the Haafingar area.)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]Egoistic, Unisex[/color] - Straighter posture, neck lifted - forward walk \n<br />(Thalmor, Taarie &amp; Endarie, Nirya, Maven Black-Briar- extremely subtle.)\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=2]The secondary download will allow you to select some of these animations for the player. \n<br />They look a bit exaggerated imo from a locked camera viewpoint- I'd only recommend the feminine one.[/size][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#d5a6bd]Miscellaneous[/color]\n<br />Alternate animations for some things that I've seen players dislike/complain about, as well as some animations that could simply use variety.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#d5a6bd]Wounded [/color]- 50% chance for 2 of the 3 \"wounded sitting\" animations to have a variant. \n<br />The lying on side one isn't changed due to it having an \"enter\" and \"exit\" transition.\n<br />(ex. Veezara/Arnbjorn wounded in the DB questline.)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#d5a6bd]Magical elevation[/color] - Alternate \"Float up\" and \"Float down\" animations that are less panicked and more comfortable. Requires over 150 maximum magicka points.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#d5a6bd]Lying down[/color] - 50% chance for alternate animation with hands on stomach rather than behind head. There is no transition animation for this (yet) so it might be a bit snappy or odd looking when it begins. Because of that, this one is disabled by default. Use the modular installation option to activate it.\n<br />\n<br />.\xa0 .\xa0 .\n<br />\n<br />the following animations below were [b]moved to the optional section[/b]. they are no longer part of the 'default' installation within the FOMOD.\n<br />Repurposed idles will be superseded by a new mod, and Elders has reported inconsistent, random CTDs. \n<br />I do not experience said crashes, so use at your own risk.\n<br />\n<br />...\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Repurposed Idles - Player[/color]\n<br />Repurposes vanilla idles within the game files, making them accessible for the player.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Variant 1[/color] - 20% chance\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Variant 2[/color] - 20% chance\n<br />...\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]Elderly, Unisex[/color] - Hunched idles, forward walk, run, dialogue anims, turning \n<br />(Battle Born/Grey-Mane elders, Tolfdir) (sitting anims are optional, WIP)[/quote]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Future plans:[/b]\n<br />More personality\n<br />Tweaks to egoistic/young female (discovered some more animation tools, more potential)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Elder Animations:[/b]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[left]Elder animations have been moved to the optional section of the FOMOD, it no longer comes with the 'full installation' option.\n<br />\n<br />There's obviously a problem with crashes there, but in terms of fixing it:\n<br />\n<br />1. 99% of the animations were made the same way with the same program, but it's apparently just elder stuff breaking..?\n<br />2. i don't get animation related crashes on my set ups (on my personal load order &amp; when I recorded for hours on MXR's) so i can't even test for it\n<br />3. there's no obvious indicator for what animation out of the 40 there cause said crash\n<br />\n<br />therefore testing for CTDs would be out of my hands and also incredibly tedious :&lt; sorry LOL\n<br />unless there's a way to diagnose what the exact issue is, remaking them again and hoping for it to work would probably be the best course of action hhhhhhhh[/left][/spoiler][/center]"
