Stormcloak-allied jarls will wear Nordic-styled outfits. The jarls and their appointees in the major holds will generally have better, more expensive clothing and armor than those in the minor holds.

Vigilant outfits have also been reworked so that they will spawn matching Steel boots and gauntlets, rather than a mismatch of different styles. If Wet &amp; Cold is installed, Vigilants will equip fur-lined hoods in cold regions and regular hoods in warmer regions.\xa0\n<br />[*]Asgeir will wear the male wedding outfit for his wedding, then afterwards revert back to his normal fine clothes.\n<br />[*]Dremora now wear black daedric robes with a new, unique texture.\xa0\n<br />[*]Vaermina's Devotees now have a 40% chance of having a matching purple hood.\n<br />[*]Hunters will use a greater variety of clothing (farm clothes, fur armor, or hide armor).
