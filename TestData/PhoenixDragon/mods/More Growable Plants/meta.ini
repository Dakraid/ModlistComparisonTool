nexusDescription="this is a converted version of More Plants for Hearthfire by numberland ([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26851/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26851/[/url]?) i like growing my own nirnroot. the rest is just a bonus. :)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THIS MOD[/b]. i just resaved with the SSE CK and cleaned it with the SSEedit. the permissions for the original mod state that reupload and modification is allow as long as credit is given. since the original author has not been active since August of 2016 i decided to not to wait for permission. i did send them a private message letting them know what i am doing tho so if/when they get back on they are free to take ownership or have this taken down if the need arises.\n<br />\n<br />so did i mention this was originaly made by a modder called [b]numberland[/b]? :)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />INSTALLATION\n<br />\n<br />activate via mod manager of choice\n<br />\n<br />-OR-\n<br />\n<br />drop contents of the data folder into your skyrimSE data folder\n<br />\n<br />COMPATIBILITY: this mod is compatible with mods like Hearthfire Extended {https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8450} or Lakeview Extended {https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6363} but needs to be loaded after it. Both mods also modify the growables list to add the same list of stuff from the vanilla DLC's (like\xa0scathecraw and yellow mountain flowers for example). since More Growables also adds these and more it needs to be loaded after to keep things like the blueberries and stone flowers.\n<br />\n<br />ABOUT THE MOD\n<br />The mods add the following plants and ingredients to the hearthfire planters - both indoor planters and the gardens.\n<br />\n<br />Since many of these plants do not have harvestable version out in the world [b]\"seeds\" have been added to the hearthfire building chest that shows up next to your house building workbench. the chest contains 3 of everything growable added by this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Simple version added. it doesn't add anything new just make stuff grow that was not growable before, like nirnroot.\xa0[b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/b]This mod has been cleaned with xEdit for SkyrimSE[b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Base game plants:[/b] \n<br />Nirnroot \n<br />Crimson Nirnroot \n<br />Frost Mirriam \n<br />Elves Ear \n<br />\n<br />New Meshes: \n<br />Jarrin Root --- totally over powered. you have been warned.\n<br />Tomato\xa0\n<br />Red Apple\n<br />Green Apple \n<br />Garlic \n<br />Moon Sugar \n<br />\n<br />[b]Dragonborn plants:[/b] \n<br />Trama Root \n<br />Spiky Grass Ash \n<br />Scathecraw \n<br />Ash Yam \n<br />Ash Creep Cluster \n<br />\n<br />[b]Dawnguard plants:[/b] \n<br />Yellow Mountain Flower \n<br />Soul Husk \n<br />Gleam Blossom \n<br />Poison Bloom\n<br />\n<br />[b]Nests:[/b] \n<br />Chaurus Eggs \n<br />Pine Thrush's Egg\n<br />Hawk's Egg\n<br />Chicken's Egg\n<br />Rock Warbler's Egg\n<br />\n<br />New Content from numberland\n<br />Blueberries - resist shock, fortify pickpocket, slow, paralysis\n<br />Saltrice - restore stamina, damage stamina, fortify magicka, restore health\n<br />Sugar - restore health, fortify speech, cure disease, weakness to poison\n<br />Stone flower - restore stamina, fortify magicka, slow, fortify speech\n<br />recipes for  Blueberry Crostata, Long Taffy Treat, Boiled Creme Treat, Honey Nut Treat, Moon Sugar, Butter and Spiced Wine.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />SSE Version 1.0 initial conversion\n<br />SSE Version 1.1 learned how to properly update nifs and textures. applied fixes.\n<br />SSE Version 1.2 fixed tomato visibility and poison bloom positioning, made the chaurus eggs actually give chaurus eggs instead of chicken eggs, gave all recipes a pass for corrections\n<br />SSE Version 1.3 added \"seeds\" back into the chest. forgot to do this when i started over with the original mod. also reverted the name change on the esp so as not to break the bruma patch\n<br />SSE Version 1.4 fixed ash yams giving apples instead of yams.\n<br />SSE version 1.5 added ingredient effects for new plants to description page. fixed all three birds nests (thanks khulse and drfnord!). increased the scale of both apple bushes into actual apple trees. don't grow them indoors or super close to your house anymore. 1.5 is purely a model update, no new esp, so no new patches should be needed for bruma or caco users. o7"
