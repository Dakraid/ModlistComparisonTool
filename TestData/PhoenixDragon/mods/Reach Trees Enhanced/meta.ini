nexusDescription="I understand why no one has tried to \"fix\" the Reach trees - they're atrocious. It'd probably be easier to recreate them from scratch.\n<br />\n<br />But with hanging moss inextricably tied to these meshes, I figured why not. I'm sick of seeing the egregious UV errors anyway.\n<br />\n<br />Tri count isn't insane, both models are &lt;10k total. The trees now use Spooknik's hi res textures. Default is 4k with parallax (heightmap is 1k).\n<br />\n<br />Branches emanate from the tree, no more floating branches.\n<br />\n<br />Additionally, the roots have been separated from the branches and use Kartoffel's hi res upscaled root texture. \n<br />\n<br />New collision has been generated.\n<br />\n<br />Lower res textures and no parallax version are available in the optional section.\n<br />\n<br />I didn't touch the cliff trees because they can be replaced easily, and I don't think they're used for hanging moss.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks for taking the time to read the description.\n<br />\n<br />Feel free to use in your mod."
