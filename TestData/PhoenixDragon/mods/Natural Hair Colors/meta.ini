nexusDescription="[b][color=#f9cb9c][size=4]The mod:[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />I really like\xa0nicostein's Mild Hair Colors and used it for a while, but I have a few nitpicks with it when it comes to how it affects NPC hair that I wanted to address:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Mild Hair Colors swaps the \"Light Grey\" and \"White\" hair colors for seemingly no reason, and since it also makes the white color brighter, this means NPCs that used to have grey hair now had bright white hair after rebuilding facegen\n<br />[*]MHC also does something similar with the various blond hair colors: \"Dark Blond\" becomes \"Ginger\" which I found a bit jarring visually, it turns Bright Blond into Amber which is darker than Light Blond instead of brighter, Auburn and Chestnut are also swapped. You get the idea.\n<br />[*]MHC makes the Albino hair color identical to the White one, but I'd rather preserve that additional bit of variety the Vanilla game has.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />So I decided to make my own hair color replacer to address the above by doing the following:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]I rearranged and individually tweaked every Blond/Red-ish and White/Grey color to better match the Vanilla colors while still getting rid of the unnatural hues they had. I found the Brown and Black hair colors from MHC to be pretty much spot on so I left them as is\n<br />[*]I renamed most colors besides Black to better fit the Vanilla names, since ultimately what I want is to keep things consistent. This won't matter for a lot of people, but if you use use xedit to view or edit NPCs you won't be confused as to which color is which\n<br />[*]I tweaked the Albino color, it will once again be brighter than the White color so Snow Elf hair will keep its distinct look\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />If you want NPCs to use these hair colors you have to rebuild your FaceGen, that's because the RGB values for NPC hair are baked into the FaceGeom meshes.\n<br />\n<br />If you are not familiar with facegen or are not sure how to proceed,\xa0I would suggest reading the\xa0[url=https://thephoenixflavour.com/tpf/finalisation/facegen/]facegen part[/url]\xa0\x66rom the guide\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14223]The Phoenix Flavour.[/url]\n<br />That part, like the rest is made specifically for the guide but I think it should be easy to understand and adapt to your setup regardless. If not, I'm sure you can find many great resources to learn about facegen.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f9cb9c][size=4]Compatibility:\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color][/b]Compatible with everything, but if another plugin edits one (or more) of the Vanilla colors you'll have to choose which mod's color(s) overwrite the other's.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f9cb9c][size=4]Credits:[/size][/color]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/33286635]nicostein[/url]\xa0\x66or their [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27013]Mild Hair Colors[/url]\xa0mod, showing how much the vanilla hair colors could be improved\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40658]Nordic Faces[/url]\xa0was used in those screenshots along with\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41863]High Poly Vanilla Hair[/url].\n<br />The hair textures included in Nordic Faces are the 2K Rough option from\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36510]Superior Lore-Friendly Hair[/url].\n<br />I also use\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1062]Brows[/url]\xa0\x61nd\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1067]Beards[/url]\xa0(\"Low\" res option for both)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f9cb9c][size=4][b]My other mods:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46305]\n<br />Mourning Restored\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46307]Faster Horse Dismount SSE\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46357]Faster Reanimation\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46739]Less Bright Teeth for Expressive Facegen Morphs\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47985]Hooded Skeleton Corpse Fix for WACCF\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48574]Majestic Mountains - Mesh Tangent Space Fixes[/url]"
