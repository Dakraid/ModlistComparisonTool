nexusDescription="________________\n<br />DESCRIPTION\n<br />-----------------------\n<br />This project started out with me wanting to create a retexture of the gourd, since there aren't many options for that on the Nexus.\n<br />I luckily started out retexturing the branches and leaves of the world model, because I soon realized the stretching on the UV map of the gourd itself was just too bad to make anything decent out of it.\n<br />\n<br />So I then decided to use the gourd model from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25798]Mathy's repository[/url] instead.\n<br />\n<br />In order to keep the animations of the leaves intact I had to edit out the gourds of the vanilla model in blender, but I'm happy to say I got them working :)\n<br />The switch node which ensures the gourds disappear from the plant when harvested also still works.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />________________\n<br />COMPATIBILITY\n<br />-----------------------\n<br />This mod should be compatible with any retextures, but keep in mind that only the leaves and branches will change. The gourd itself uses a different model and texture.\n<br />It is incompatible with mods that alter the gourd model."
