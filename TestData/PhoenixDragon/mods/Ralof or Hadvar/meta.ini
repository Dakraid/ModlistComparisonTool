nexusDescription="I know... I know... [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557]Alternate Start Live Another Life[/url] rocks, but this is simply a setting built into Skyrim itself which \n<br />bypasses the carriage ride and lets you choose who you wish to follow. \n<br />Ralof or Hadvar starting the Unbound quest.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Seems to be compatible with Opening Scene Overhaul. Load Ralof or Hadvar after it.\n<br />I don't think its compatible with any mod that alters the beginning of the game.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][b]Update\n<br />-220209[/b][/size]\n<br />I was concerned about the vanilla bandits not spawning in Helgen on the forth day because of compatibility w/ the mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5673]Helgen Reborn[/url] that I've never played but always wanted to. I've tested it pretty extensively today w/ \"Ralof or Hadvar\" and from my testing it was always compatible. I just didn't know it. as a matter of fact it may be started prior to having the shackles removed from your character. As stated in the past when exiting the Helgen cave Helgen will already be on fire from the dragon attack. The fire will burn for 3 days and then will self extinguish.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5673]Helgen Reborn[/url] changes with uploaded patch\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The patch is not imperative to have to be able run [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5673]Helgen Reborn[/url]\xfeff with Ralof or Hadvar. It simply addresses things that stuck out to me.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*]Book doesn't auto spawn in player's inventory. Quest now starts with a note nailed to the Whiterun Drunken Huntsmen's entryway(see screenshot).\n<br />[*]Book text was changed from technical instructions on how to get mod working to an in game Reward notice looking for the survivor of the Helgen disastor.\n<br />[*]Resized Trigger to initiated dialogue with Balfring for the first time when entering either Helgen gate instead of just one.\n<br />[*]Dialogue change from \"You're looking for me? What are you talking about?\" to \"What do you want?\" for fluidity the first time speaking w/ Patsy.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />I see no reason to ever not run the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5673]Helgen Reborn[/url] mod along side Ralof or Hadvar because it just provides a treasure trove of content in place of a simple vanilla bandit spawn. Don't rob yourself of great content. Helgen Reborn is not w/ out it's occasional bug at certain points because its so choreographed by scripts, but so far for me nothing that closing Skyrim and opening again didn't solve. Come to think of it I would say it would be an engine bug opposed to Helgen Reborn having the bug. We'll just have to wait for the boys over at OpenMW to make an OpenSky engine or officially support Skyrim data file within OpenMW.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][b]Update\n<br />-220206[/b][/size]\n<br />Do not upgrade to this version until you are ready for a new game. Imperial archer was not obeying because creation kit changed form versions when updating to SE. They were purposely not suppose to change. Bandits are no longer spawning when the Helgen fire is extinguished after 3 days. Don't know why will revisit some day.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Update\n<br />-191111[/b]\n<br />I over looked the Helgen North Gate lock in prior versions because I was \n<br />teleporting around for testing. It Wasn't game breaking but annoying \n<br />that the gate was locked and there is no key for it in the game.\xa0 \n<br />[b]\n<br />Update\n<br />-180323[/b]\n<br />Fixed Helgen. Helgen is now burning When exiting dungeon and works as \n<br />originally intended. After 3 days the fires will die. After 4 days and \n<br />telling the Whiterun Jarl Balgruuf that Helgen was attacked. Bandits will\n<br /> takeover Helgen. Make sure to exit through Dragon's Reach doors and not\n<br /> just teleport out.\n<br />\n<br />There are no scripts. Updating the mod should fix any Helgen issues.\n<br />\n<br />Same version works for Skyrim32 and Skyrim64"
