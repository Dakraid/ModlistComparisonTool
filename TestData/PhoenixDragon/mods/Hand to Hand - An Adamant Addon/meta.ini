nexusDescription="[color=#93c47d][center][size=5][b]Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon[/b][/size]\xa0[/center][/color]\n<br />Hand to Hand is an addon for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191]Adamant - A Perk Overhaul[/url] that merges Lockpicking and Pickpocketing into a single skill and adds a new perk tree for Hand to Hand combat. It also makes some adjustments to Adamant\x2019s Light and Heavy Armor trees to support these changes. Merging Lockpicking and Pickpocketing into a single tree improves thief gameplay by reducing the number of\xa0 non-combat skills that players need to invest in. It also creates space to add a new, fully integrated perk tree for Hand to Hand. This allows for full support for unarmed combat as a legitimate and competitive gameplay style, while also untethering unarmed from either light or heavy armor.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][size=4][b]Requirements\xa0[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Hand to Hand requires [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444]Address Library for SKSE Plugins[/url]\xa0[/b]to be installed.[b]\xa0[/b]Hand to Hand is compatible with both pre-AE (1.5.97) and post-AE (1.6+) versions of Skyrim. The same DLL works for both versions.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67518]Unarmed Weapon Speed Scaling[/url]\xa0is also a \"soft\" requirement for this mod. Without this mod, the perk Momentum will not apply to unarmed power attacks.

I decided not to go that route, because I felt that it would hurt Xbox players for no real benefit.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][size=4][b]Hand to Hand - Trainers and Skill Books Addon[/b][/size][/color]\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Hand to Hand also makes several changes to trainers and skill books.\xa0\x42\x65\x63\x61use these changes necessitate a USSEP requirement, and because they require me to alter NPC records, I have decided to make these changes in the \x201cTrainers and Skill Books\x201d optional file. This means that users can decide whether they\x2019\x64 rather go through the trouble of patching their load orders for this file, or whether they would rather deal with a few small inconsistencies instead.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Hand to Hand makes the following changes to trainers:\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Vex is no longer a trainer.\xa0\n<br />[*]The training dialogue for Silda and Vipir now references Security instead of Pickpocket.\xa0\n<br />[*]Ma'jhad is now an Expert Hand to Hand trainer.\xa0\n<br />[*]Chief Mauhulakh is now a Master Hand to Hand trainer.\n<br />[*]Minor edits to the outfits and equipment of Ma'jhad and Chief Mauhulakh.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Hand to Hand also makes several edits to skill books. Since every skill has exactly five skill books, I have chosen not to make all Lockpicking skill books into Security skill books. The following books are Security skill books:\xa0\x41\x64vances in Lockpicking; Proper Lock Design; Surfeit of Thieves; Guide to Better Thieving; and Thief. The following books [i]were[/i]\xa0skill books in the Vanilla game, but are no longer skill books:\xa0The Locked Room; The Wolf Queen, v1;\xa0\x41\x65var Stone-Singer; Beggar; and Purloined Shadows. The following books are now Hand to Hand skill books:\xa0The Wolf Queen, v2; Immortal Blood;\xa0The Prayers of Baranat; Master Zoaraym\x2019s Tale; and\xa0Way of the Exposed Palm. Immortal Blood and The Wolf Queen, v2 are both Vanilla books that were Hand to Hand skill books in Oblivion.\xa0The Prayers of Baranat, Master Zoaraym\x2019s Tale, and\xa0Way of the Exposed Palm\xa0were skill books in either Morrowind and Oblivion and were added by Hand to Hand. A patch for Book Covers Skyrim - Lost Library has been provided.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][size=4][b]Hand to Hand - Armor Addon\n<br />[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />This addon changes the requirements for every relevant Light Armor, Heavy Armor, and Alteration perk so that these perks [i]only [/i]care what armor piece is in your chest slot. Wearing a Light Armor chest piece qualifies you for Light Armor perks. Wearing a Heavy Armor chest piece qualifies you for Heavy Armor perks. Whether neither chest piece qualifies you for the relevant Alteration perks. This significantly simplifies the armor requirements and allows players to mix and match armor types in the most balanced way possible. In addition, this addon allows the mastery perks for Light Armor and Heavy Armor to affect Light Armor and Heavy Armor shields, respectively.

This is one of the only possible bonuses to the player's lockpicking ability that is \"worth\" a perk point.

Allow my .ini file to overwrite the one from the mod itself.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#93c47d][size=4]FAQ[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[quote]Q. Why is this mod separate from Adamant? Why is this not an \x201cofficial\x201d Adamant update?\xa0\n<br />\n<br />A. Since this mod requires SKSE and comes with its own DLL, I decided it would be best to keep it separate from Adamant for the time being. This allows me to avoid adding an SKSE dependency\xa0 to a mod two years after release. It also allows me to support Xbox users with as little headache as possible. In the (far distant) future, if I ever created a Simonrim AIO, I would include this mod. I consider it an \x201cofficial\x201d part of Simonrim and recommend that everyone who likes Adamant downloads it.\n<br />\n<br />Q. Why does this mod have its own mod page? Shouldn\x2019t it be an Adamant Addon like Plus Ten Smithing?\n<br />\n<br />A. I felt that this mod represented a substantial amount of work and deserved its own mod page, especially since a lot of that work was done by Colin and Jelidity (it also makes it easy to share DP from this project directly, rather than splitting off an arbitrary % of Adamant\x2019s DP for them).\n<br />\n<br />Q. Why doesn\x2019t this mod use Custom Skills Framework?\xa0\n<br />\n<br />One of my major goals for this project is total, seamless integration with the Vanilla game. Using Custom Skills Framework would not help me reach this goal, because the perk tree would not be integrated with the rest of the Vanilla perks. In addition, merging Lockpicking and Pickpocketing into one Security tree is just as important to me as adding the new Hand to Hand tree.\xa0I have considered using Custom Skills Framework for other projects, where it makes sense for the skill trees to be separated from your normal suite of perks (similar to how the Vanilla game handles Werewolf and Vampire Lord).\n<br />\n<br />Q: Why is this tree called Security? Shouldn\x2019t it be called [insert suggestion here]?\n<br />\n<br />Security is the name that Morrowind and Oblivion use for the Lockpicking skill. Whenever I can, I defer to TES tradition. Also, your suggestion sucks.[/quote]\xa0[color=#93c47d][size=4][b]Compatibility[/b][/size][/color]\xa0\n<br />\n<br />While the changes that this mod makes are somewhat aggressive, every effort has been made to ensure compatibility. All bonuses to lockpicking and pickpocketing should still function as expected, and it should be compatible with all UI Overhauls.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />One change we needed to make may cause a very small number of users a problem. We needed to change the word \x201cLockpicking\x201d to the word \x201cSecurity\x201d in the Lockpicking UI. We had several options, but we decided the option that made the most sense to the most players was to make use of the English translation file. If this causes you to experience an incompatibility, feel free to reach out. We may be able to help you by sharing an optional approach (such as a .swf edit).\n<br />\n<br />If you'd like to use assets from this mod to make an addon for another perk overhaul besides Adamant, please feel free. You can find everything you need for the art files in the download of this mod, and you can find the source for Colin's DLL [url=https://github.com/colinswrath/handtohand]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][size=4][b]My Other Mods\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size][/color][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686]Aetherius - A Race Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411]Mundus - A Standing Stone Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839]Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191]Adamant - A Perk Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487]Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549]Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639]Scion - A Vampire Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746]Manbeast - A Werewolf Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130]Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099]Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul\xa0\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138]Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul\n<br />\n<br />[/url][b][color=#93c47d][size=4]Colinswrath's Other Mods[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414]Sunhelm Survival and Needs\xa0\n<br />[/url][/b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56374]Survival Mode Improved\xa0\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55114]Incremental Injuries\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[b][color=#93c47d][size=4]Jelidity's Other Mods[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56123]CoMAP - Common Marker Extension Project[/url]\xa0\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59460]Functional Fearsome Fists\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51529]Amber Refossilised\xa0\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41348]Stalhrim Refrozen[/url]"
