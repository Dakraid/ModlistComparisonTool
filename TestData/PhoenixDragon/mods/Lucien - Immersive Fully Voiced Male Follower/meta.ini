A scholar by trade, Lucien is visiting Skyrim on an expedition and may be found looking for a travelling companion in Dead Man's Drink, in Falkreath. Though he is something of a coward when you first meet him, with barely enough combat skill to hold a sword, he will dynamically learn from you as you travel together, gaining both strength and confidence until he grows into a hero in his own right.\n<br />\n<br />Despite his initial lack of confidence, Lucien is enthusiastic and optimistic and will comment on both your location and [url=https://josephrussellauthor.com/Lucien_Quests.html]active quests[/url] (but will stick to whispering while you're sneaking.) He has a [url=https://josephrussellauthor.com/Lucien_Books.html]small pool of books[/url] he can read to you out loud, and will chat to certain NPCs during normal play.\xa0He even has [url=https://josephrussellauthor.com/Lucien_Followers.html]custom interactions[/url] with over 25 other mods, including special banter scenes with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461]Inigo[/url],\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278]Auri[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19075]Kaidan[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16137]Hoth[/url],\xa0written and recorded in collaboration with their original voice actors.\n<br />\n<br />Lucien has his own follower system, so does not contribute towards your follower count. He is essential while he travels with you, although should you choose, you can kill him. He starts at level 10,\xa0\x62ut will increase in skill as he travels with you, learning both from you and by himself over time. You can also give him lessons in particular skills to accelerate his training. Initially, he knows Frostbite, Flames and Healing, though you can teach him further spells from a [url=https://josephrussellauthor.com/Lucien_Spells.html]select pool[/url] if you have a copy of the spell tome to give him. All his spells can be toggled on and off once he has learned them should you no longer wish him to cast them. His combat style is customisable, and he can fight as a warrior, mage or archer in addition to his own default all-rounder style.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f5deb3][size=4]Features[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Over 5000 lines of fully-voiced, immersive, lore-friendly dialogue.\n<br />[*]Full commentary on Skyrim's Main Quest, the College of Winterhold and Companions questlines and [url=https://josephrussellauthor.com/Lucien_Quests.html]numerous side quests[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />[*]Two new quests set in a unique Dwemer ruin built by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10423]Darkend[/url] creator [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1305814]JKrojmal[/url].\n<br />[*]A stat-based Dynamic Personality System, where Lucien may gain or lose Approval or Bravery based on his interactions with you and the choices you make, altering his behaviour and dialogue.\n<br />[*]A custom Training System where Lucien will gradually gain levels in skills you are better than him at, accelerated by lessons in specific skills ([url=https://josephrussellauthor.com/Lucien_Spells.html]and spells[/url]\xfeff) you can give him once per in-game day.\n<br />[*]Custom combat AI allowing Lucien to use support spells like Healing Hands and Courage (once taught) and to dynamically select the best cloak spell for each battle.\n<br />[*]A unique horse-riding system, unlocked by completing Lucien's personal quests.\n<br />[*]A [url=https://josephrussellauthor.com/Lucien_Books.html]small pool of books[/url]\xfeff Lucien can read to you out loud if you have them in your inventory.\n<br />[*]Many customisation options such as combat style and spell-toggling, configurable through dialogue or through the MCM.\n<br />[*]Interaction with over 25 other mods, including full commentary on the questlines of Moonpath to Elsweyr and Moon and Star and fully-voiced banter scenes with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461]Inigo[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16137]Hoth[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278]Auri[/url].\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[center][color=#f5deb3][size=3]Check out the [url=http://josephrussellauthor.com/Flavius_Chronicles.html]Flavius Chronicles[/url]\xfeff - an ongoing series of prequel short stories set before Lucien's arrival in Skyrim!\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.patreon.com/josephrussellauthor][img]http://josephrussellauthor.com/assets/images/Patreon%20Button.png[/img]\xfeff[/url]\xfeff[/size][/color][/center]\n<br />[size=4][color=wheat]Requirements[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />None. However, if you have SKSE64 and SkyUI, Lucien's MCM will activate, allowing you to view his stats, change his combat style and toggle his spells on and off. See the Mod Interaction section for details on other mods Lucien can interact with.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f5deb3][size=4]Compatibility\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color]There are no mods Lucien is [b]directly[/b]\xa0incompatible with. Lucien falls victim to an issue with Shiva's Vanilla Clothing Replacer (if you're not using the No Nails and Capes Version), where followers will always prefer Fine Clothes to armor, so I've made a patch for that available. Additionally, as he has his own custom follower system, you really shouldn't use other mods to control him. This includes follower management mods such as EFF, NFF, AFT etc., mods which \"assign\" NPCs a home such as MHIYH, and anything else designed to change Lucien's behaviour - much like Inigo, these are likely to break his brain!\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f5deb3][size=4]Installation\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color]Download the main file and any mod-interaction patches and, preferably, activate them via a mod manager such as NMM or Vortex. If you don't use a mod manager, you can extract the esp and bsa\xa0\x61nd place them in your data folder instead.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f5deb3][size=4]Updating\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color]Generally speaking (though Skyrim can always throw a wobbly every now and again if it wants to), Lucien is safe to update mid-playthrough. Uninstall the old version, either with your mod manager or by deleting Lucien.esp and Lucien.bsa from your data folder. Then download and install the new version. Do [b]NOT[/b]\xa0load up the game in between these steps i.e. without Lucien installed. This used to be called making a \"clean save\" and is a bad practice which will irreparably ruin your save.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f5deb3][size=4]Uninstallation\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color]Skyrim as a rule does not support the uninstallation of a mod mid-playthrough, so I can't provide any support if doing so causes you issues. However, if you need to uninstall Lucien for whatever reason, you can do so using your mod manager or by deleting the esp and bsa from your data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f5deb3][size=4]Mod Interaction\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color]Lucien comes with custom interaction with a number of other mods. Many of these trigger automatically if you have the relevant mods installed. Some, however, require a patch - these are indicated with a *. This list will grow with each update, but at the moment the mods are:\n<br />\n<br />[u]Creation Club[/u]\n<br />\n<br />[If you're using Skyrim Anniversary Edition, you can now use the Lucien - Anniversary Edition - All-In-One Creation Club Patch, which is a merged version of all the individual Creation Club patches. Use this or the individual patches but not both. Please note this is not compatible with saves which previously used the individual patches, so you'll need to start a new character if you want to switch over.]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]*Adventurer's Backpack\n<br />[*]*Alternative Armors - Dwarven Mail\n<br />[*]*Alternative Armors - Elven Hunter\n<br />[*]*Alternative Armors - Silver\n<br />[*]Arcane Accessories\n<br />[*]*Arcane Archer Pack\n<br />[*]*Bone Wolf\n<br />[*]*Bow of Shadows\n<br />[*]*Camping\n<br />[*]Dwarven Armored Mudcrab\n<br />[*]*Expanded Crossbow Pack\n<br />[*]*Forgotten Seasons\n<br />[*]*Goblins\n<br />[*]*Headman's Cleaver\n<br />[*]*Lord's Mail\n<br />[*]*Myrwatch\n<br />[*]Nix-Hound\n<br />[*]*Plague of the Dead\n<br />[*]*Rare Curios\n<br />[*]*Ruin's Edge\n<br />[*]*Saints and Seducers\n<br />[*]*Saturalia Holiday Pack\n<br />[*]*Shadowrend\n<br />[*]*Staff of Sheogorath\n<br />[*]*Stendarr's Hammer\n<br />[*]*Tundra Homestead\n<br />[*]*Umbra\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[u]Unofficial Mods[/u]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272]Alternate Start - Live Another Life[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1163]Anna NPCs[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090]Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13016]Celia the Kettle-Maiden[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4043]Helarchen Creek[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16137]Hoth[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461]Inigo[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41856]I'm Glad You're Here\xfeff[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19075]Kaidan[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14353]Keld-Nar[/url]\n<br />[*]*[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4301]Moon and Star[/url]\n<br />[*]*[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4341]Moonpath to Elsweyr[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4718]Recorder[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2180]Sofia[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278]Song of the Green[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17423]Telengard[/url]\n<br />[*]*[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42522]Triple Triad Card Game in Skyrim[/url]\xfeff [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68993][External Patch]\xfeff[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6722]Vilja[/url]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[center][color=#f5deb3][size=3]For more info, visit [url=http://josephrussellauthor.com/Lucien.html]the official Lucien website[/url]\xfeff.[/size][/color][/center][color=#f5deb3][size=3]\n<br />FAQ[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Q: Where do I find Lucien?\n<br />A: He's waiting for you in Dead Man's Drink, in Falkreath.[*]Q: Can I marry him?\n<br />A: I'm afraid not - the story I'm writing here is very much one of friendship. Feel free to headcanon to your heart's content, though![*]Q: Can he ride a horse?\n<br />A: Yes! You'll unlock it by completing Lucien's two personal quests.[*]Q: How do I start Lucien's quests?\n<br />A: It'll happen naturally once Lucien likes you enough. Ask him if there's anywhere in particular he'd like to see and then some time later, when he's ready, it'll be sprung upon you. Once you've completed the first quest, the second one should start on its own around five in-game days after you next recruit Lucien.[*]Q: Why doesn't Lucien's level increase above 10?\n<br />A: Lucien's training gradually increases his individual skills, but not his level. This is because recalculating an NPC's level based on their skills is a massive pain, and a considerable waste of resources if you bear in mind that a follower's level has no practical effect apart from controlling which Illusion spells work on them, and it isn't viewable in-game without the use of mods or the console. [*]Q: I modified Lucien myself and now he doesn't work anymore.\n<br />A: I'm afraid I really can't recommend or provide support for people modifying Lucien themselves - it's simply too unpredictable and difficult to troubleshoot.[*]Q: I'm the modder/voice actor behind another custom-voiced follower mod and think it'd be cool if our followers could interact.\n<br />A: Awesome! Send me a PM and I'd be delighted to start setting up some conversations.[*]Q: I'm a modder and I'd like to make a patch/translation that modifies Lucien in some way.\n<br />A: That's cool. Generally speaking, I'm happy for people to make patches and translations for Lucien [b]on the condition[/b] that they get in touch with me first and let me know what they're planning on doing. I deal with all support issues myself, and it's a real pain to help solve problems if other people have been mucking around with Lucien without my knowledge, so [b]please\xa0[/b]make sure you get permission from me if you're going to be modifying Lucien in any way. I won't bite, I promise.[*]Q: Is this mod still being worked on?\n<br />A: Yes, absolutely. I have no plans to stop working on Lucien at least until The Elder Scrolls VI is released, and you can watch me work on the mod [url=https://www.twitch.tv/josephrusselluk]live on Twitch[/url]\xfeff every Thursday at 17:00 UK time.[*]Q: Will you add interactions with Legacy of the Dragonborn and/or Beyond Skyrim: Bruma?\n<br />A: Yes, both of these are planned, but I can't give you an estimate for when they'll be ready.[*]Q: Why is my game crashing in Dumzbthar?\n<br />A: Dwemer ruin texture/mesh improvement mods like Dwemer Pipework Reloaded can overstress your graphics card in large Dwemer ruins like Dumzbthar. Try disabling your Dwemer ruin mods and see if that helps.[*]Q: I'm using an old version of Skyrim Special Edition (e.g. v1.9.57) and don't want to update - which version of Lucien should I use?\n<br />A: Lucien doesn't have any version-specific features, so in theory any version of Lucien should work on any version of Skyrim SE. However, I always test and develop Lucien on the very latest version of Skyrim, so this is the only one I can provide support for. You're welcome to use him on any other version of Skyrim at your own risk, but please don't post bug reports if you run into issues doing so.[*]Q: Can I request a name to add to the custom names list?\n<br />A: Unfortunately not. I used to offer this as a Patreon perk but have been banned from doing so by the Nexus, and if I started doing requests for everyone who asked it'd take up literally all my time and Lucien would never get any other new features. Sorry![/list]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f5deb3][size=4]Credits\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color][list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4958252]Joseph Russell[/url]\xfeff - Writing, Voice Acting, Quest Design, Scripting (and everything else not listed below)\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1305814]JKrojmal[/url]\xa0- Level Design\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/7465756]Smartbluecat[/url]\xfeff\xa0- Writing and Voice Acting for Inigo Interaction\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2424584]Waribiki[/url]\xa0- Writing and Voice Acting for Auri Interaction\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/139207]Jase180[/url]\xa0- Writing and Voice Acting for Hoth Interaction\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/18913224]Livtempleton[/url]\xfeff - Writing for Kaidan Interaction\n<br />[*][url=https://twitter.com/dlemonvo?lang=en]Daniel Matthew Lemon[/url]\xfeff - Voice Acting for Kaidan Interaction\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4805966]Anduniel[/url]\xfeff - Writing and Voice Acting for AnnaNPCs Interaction\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1565110]Niborino9409[/url]\xa0- Face Design, Testing and Screenshots\n<br />[*]Amata - Testing\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/10744573]AugustBeast[/url]\xa0- Testing\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/6297177]Craseydreams29[/url]\xfeff - Testing\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/19740759]GarnetSan\xa0[/url]\xfeff- Testing\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/8957598]Gnewna\xa0[/url]\xfeff- Testing\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/28823630]PhysicsFish\xa0[/url]\xfeff- Testing\n<br />[*]Ragnarok N' Roll - Testing\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/48545163]TheBlackCr0w[/url]\xfeff - Testing\n<br />[*]ValkyrieEir - Testing\n<br />[*]Maadpaw - Testing and help with Inigo Interaction\n<br />[*]Beowulf1967 - Help with Inigo Interaction\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1702646]Hanaisse[/url]\xa0-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18957]Oblivion Gate resources[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3863233]Vicn[/url]\xa0-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6069]Creature resources[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#f5deb3][size=4]My Other Mods[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65722]Croc[/url]\xfeff[/size]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15882]Unofficial Moonpath to Elsweyr Patch[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12951]Unofficial Creation Club Updates[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5245]Joseph Russell's Writing Patches[/url]\n<br />[url=https://rd.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11069]Beyond Skyrim - Bruma Moonpath to Elsweyr Synergy Patch[/url]\xa0\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10933]Beyond Skyrim - Bruma WARZONES - Assault Attack Compatibility Patch\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17948]Beyond Skyrim - Bruma - Unofficial Ayleid Load Screen[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17948]\xa0Hotfix[/url]\n<br />\xa0 \xa0[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10874]Unofficial Mihail Monsters and Animals Patches[/url]\xa0\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10751]Moon and Star WARZONES - Assault Attack Compatibility Patch[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10933]\n<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7323]House Dres[/url]\xa0\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6358]Sulfur\xa0\x61nd Fire[/url]\xa0\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10423]Darkend\n<br />[/url]\xfeff\n<br />In addition to modding, I'm a semi-professional writer in my spare time! \xa0If you'd like to see some of my other stuff (short stories, books, blog posts etc.) then I'd absolutely love you to support me by checking out\xa0[url=http://www.josephrussellauthor.com/]my website[/url],\xa0or alternatively, if you're one of those wonderful people who'd like to help pay my rent, by buying a copy of\xa0[url=https://amzn.to/2VziEn0]my latest novel[/url]\xfeff![/center]"
