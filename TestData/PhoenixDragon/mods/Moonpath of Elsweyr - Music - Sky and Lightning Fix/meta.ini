nexusDescription="If you've played Moonpath to Elsweyr, you might have noticed the very bright (completely white) sky, and also the absence of a day-night cycle. This is because of the strange way lightning was implemented in the mod, which was probably caused by a technical limitation of the time. If you liked that for the dreamy feeling it gave, this mod is not for you. \n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/18683/18683-1531933998-605264796.jpeg[/img]\n<br />What this mod does is remove the very bright permanent light from Moonpath's cells, and add a proper sky lightning to them, with a day-night cycle, etc. It's not thought for a particular ENB, as I edited it with ENB off, but don't expect incredibly beautiful sunsets or something, as I'm not much of an artist myself. What I did was add custom weather in a non-ugly way and make the sky work. If you want to see how it looks, check the images section, and videos are of course very welcome. Now, onto the technicalities.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]To-do\n<br />[/b]While the mod is completely playable right now, I'll probably improve it some more later. Some ideas I have are adding rain and other types of weather to Moonpath, and improving on the topal sea island, which right now doesn't look [i]bad [/i]but has a somewhat weird seam at the sea's edge, especially without ENBs.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility\n<br />[/b]This mod is incompatible with mods that edit the cell forms for the Moonpath mod. A mod that does this is [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18649]Custom Music for Moonpath to Elsweyr[/url], also by me, for which a patch and a merged plugin are included (even if you use the merged plugin, please refer to that mod's page for fixes to a common issue or two and notes on compatibility, etc.) . Another is [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11069]Beyond Skyrim: Bruma - Moonpath to Elsweyr Synergy Patch[/url], which can be fixed by putting this mod (or the patch for this and Moonpath Music, or the merged plugin) in a higher position in the load order (as in high number, low on the list, in other words make it load after) than the Beyond Skyrim Synergy Patch.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation\n<br />[/b]This mod can be installed mid-playthrough. As for uninstalling mid-playthrough, it is script-free, but be careful anyway.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Suggested mods[/b]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15882]Unofficial Moonpath to Elsweyr Patch[/url] by Joseph Russell (fixes various bugs)[b]\n<br />[/b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11069]Beyond Skyrim: Bruma - Moonpath to Elsweyr Synergy Patch[/url] by Joseph Russell (not necessary at all, but quite nice if you have both mods) \n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18649]Custom Music for Moonpath to Elsweyr[/url]\xfeff by me, fixes another oversight in Moonpath, that is the vanillla nordic music in a tropical setting. Also has custom combat music for Moonpath!\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802]Legacy of the Dragonborn SSE[/url]\xfeff by icecreamassassin, I would recommend this incredible mod regardless of having Moonpath but it also adds some Moonpath-related content (for example, one of its first main quests sends you towards Moonpath's locations).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]My other works\n<br />[img width=259,height=171]https://i.imgur.com/poqzSAG.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[/b]I also make The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth mods, and I'm collaborating in the (dare I say) DLC-sized [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1258079052]Revelations [/url]\xfeffmod, that has a published second chapter. If you play that game, you're welcome to take a look."
