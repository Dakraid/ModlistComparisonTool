Both of those mentioned mods' seasons systems are included in one place.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Features[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Dynamically altered Globals based on month that can be attached to weathers in Region records through a patch\n<br />[*]MCM interface for customizing weather chances for each month\n<br />[*]Seasonal Imagespaces\n<br />[*]A simple Load/Save settings so you don't have to adjust again upon New Game (Requires:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13048]PapyrusUtil SE - Modders Scripting Utility[/url])\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Install[/size][/b]\n<br />\xa0 1. Install Seasonal Weathers Framework\n<br />\xa0 2. Install a weather mod of your choice (See Patches available section to see what weather mods are covered)\n<br />\xa0 3. Install the patch for the weather mod you chose\xa0(see available patches in Files section)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Patches available[/size][/b]\n<br />Patches are available for the following weathers mods:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Vanilla weathers[/b] (you can use this version to add seasonal weathers support to any weathers mod, as long as you understand you lose new custom weathers provided by mods, just put the patch after the weather mod)\xa0\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24791]Cathedral Weathers and Seasons[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28920]Kyne's Weathers And Seasons[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11578]Mythical Ages[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27141]NAT.ENB III - Natural and Atmospheric Tamriel ENB 3.0[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38655?tab=files]NLA[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12125]Obsidian Weathers and Seasons[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32364]Picturesque[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63116]RAID Weathers[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8398]Rustic Weathers and Lighting[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49004]SOLAS Weathers and ENB[/url]\n<br />[*]\xfeff[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2472]True Storms SE[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2187]Vivid Weathers[/url]\xa0(make sure you don't have Winter/Summer seasons optionals installed from Vivid Weathers installer)\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24439]Wander - A Weather Mod[/url]\n<br />[/list][b]\n<br />Vanilla version[/b] works for the following weathers mods:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42731]Azurite Weathers[/url]\xa0\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7895?]Dolomite Weathers[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[i][color=#b6b6b6]More patches to be done when I have more time.[/color][/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Compatibility[/size]\n<br />[/b]Seasonal Weathers Framework itself doesn't touch any vanilla records and doesn't conflict with anything.\n<br />\n<br />However, the patches available here made for weathers mods will have incompatibilities with other mods like\xa0[b]Sounds of Skyrim[/b] and [b]Audio Overhaul for Skyrim[/b]. They are incompatible because those mods also touch upon the Region records that weathers mods use.\n<br />\n<br />So, if you already use patches between weathers mods and mods like\xa0[b]Sounds of Skyrim[/b]\xa0\x61nd\xa0[b]Audio Overhaul for Skyrim[/b], you will have to edit them to include\xa0[b]Seasonal Weathers Framework[/b] as well.\n<br />\n<br />Please do not ask me for patches regarding other mods that aren't weathers mods. I leave this part to the rest of modding community.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[i][center]The following text is for people who want to make use of Seasonal Weathers Framework.[/center][size=2]\n<br />[/size][/i][b][size=5]How to integrate the seasons system into a weathers mod through a patch:[/size][/b]\n<br />\xa0 1.

Select [b]Seasonal Weathers Framework.esp\n<br />[/b]\n<br />Now that the basics are done for the patch, you need to add Seasonal Weathers Framework's Globals to your Region records in the newly made WeatherPatch.esp\n<br />\n<br />Inside\xa0WeatherPatch.esp, expand Region section and select any of the Region items inside. Scroll down to RDWT Weather Types, pick a weather on the list and in the Global line, double click on the NULL and select a global that starts with Season_ or SN_Season_\n<br />[url=https://i.imgur.com/DcouBmL.png]Example Screenshot\n<br />\n<br />[/url][i][b]Note: Most weather mods don't have snow weathers in non-snowy regions so you may need to manually add them to the Regions records and then assign them a Global.[/b][/i]\n<br />\n<br />The following [b]Globals [/b]are available for use in a patch:\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]For non-snowy regions[/u][/b]:\n<br />\n<br />Use the [b]Common [/b]set of Globals if you need the more simple seasons system similar to Obsidian Weathers, these Globals are used all seasons, but their values are changed based on month.\n<br />\n<br />Season_Common_Overcast\n<br />Season_Common_Pleasant\n<br />Season_Common_PleasantA\n<br />Season_Common_Rain\n<br />Season_Common_Rain_Storm\n<br />Season_Common_Snow\n<br />Season_Common_Snow_Storm\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ea9999]The following Globals are for weathers you want to play only during that season in non-snowy regions.
