nexusDescription="[u][b][size=5]Beyond Skyrim - Bruma + Moonpath to Elsweyr Synergy Patch[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />This is a small patch to move Moonpath to Elsweyr's Khajiit caravan from Falkreath to Greenwood, the southernmost point of County Bruma, in order to enhance the player's sense of travelling across Tamriel. \xa0I made it for my own personal use, as I love the tremendous sense of geography that comes with games like Lord of the Rings Online and wanted to carry some of that across to Skyrim now that we have the ability to visit Cyrodiil. \xa0This also includes my Immersive Start Patch that is available on the Moonpath to Elsweyr page and makes my Carriage and Ferry Travel Overhaul Compatibility Patch redundant. [b]You must uninstall both of these before installing this mod, or you will get horrible problems. [/b]My [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15882]Unofficial Moonpath to Elsweyr Patch[/url], however, is both compatible and recommended! Just make sure the \"MoonpathEnabler.pex\" and \"MoonpathEnabler.psc\" contained within this file [b]replace[/b]\xa0the ones included with the Unofficial Patch.\n<br />\n<br />With this mod installed, the Khajiit will no longer be outside Falkreath. They and their caravan will not be in the game until you have completed \"The Way of the Voice.\" When you have done so, they will appear just outside Greenwood in the south of Beyond Skyrim - Bruma's worldspace. You can't miss them. I can't easily do anything about some of the dialogue referring to Greenwood as a \"cold and unforgiving wasteland,\" but I prefer to assume Verina is referring to Cyrodiil as a whole, which though warmer than Skyrim is still positively frigid compared to the jungles of Elsweyr.\n<br />\n<br />Looking for a follower to take with you to Elsweyr?
