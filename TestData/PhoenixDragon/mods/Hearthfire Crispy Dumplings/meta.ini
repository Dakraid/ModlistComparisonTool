Annoyed that chicken, apple, and lavender dumplings all have the exact same model and texture? Look no further. All three dumplings now have their own unique models and textures so you can actually tell them apart just by looking at them.\n<br />\n<br />I really wanted to try making and sharing a mod using my own models and textures, so here we are. I modeled these three dumplings from scratch and textured them using textures from Textures.com. Textures are 2k. This mod uses an esp to add in my own models. It also replaces the oven model and animation props to include my versions of the dumplings. If you have a house mod or something that adds static meshes to the game, they will either show up as my apple dumplings or the vanilla dumplings. To explain why:\xa0\n<br />   [color=#ffe599]\xfeffIf the house mod adds the dumpling mesh as a separate object and just \"freezes\" it so it sits on a shelf or something and can't move then my mod will replace that model. If the house mod merges the dumpling mesh with another mesh (like how the dumplings in the oven mesh are all one nif file) then they will still show up as the vanilla models. I've included patches for Rustic Cooking and Skyrim 3D Cooking with permission so that their custom ovens have my dumplings inside them.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e06666][size=4][b]Installation[/b]:[/size][/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Install with a mod manager and activate, or drop the files into your data folder.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />I put a few hours into making these, so I hope you all enjoy them.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Note: This is the only official version of this mod at the moment (no LE version, but that might change at some point since converting models/textures is very easy. A console port is possible if someone else is willing to do it since I don't own Skyrim SE on console). If you see my files uploaded outside of Nexus or Bethesda.net then they were uploaded without my permission, and I can't guarantee the files will be safe.\n<br />\n<br />Check out some of my other mods:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44077]High Poly Sweet Rolls[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34730]Auriel's Bow of Light[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/FKeXD7Y.png[/img]"
