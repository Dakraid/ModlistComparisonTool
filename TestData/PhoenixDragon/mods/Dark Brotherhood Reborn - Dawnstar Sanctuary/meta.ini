This is because I'm actively working on a better sanctuary overhaul. If you'd like to see how development is going you can find me on youtube for the occasional update video, or check out my [url=https://www.facebook.com/aluckymuse]FB posted screenshots[/url].\n<br />[i]2020 Edit: Patch collection for SSE: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34909]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34909[/url]\xfeff\xa0 There is no patch collection for LE that I know of.[/i][/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/20700-0-1498929019.png[/img]\n<br />The Dark Brotherhood quest is a pretty good one. But the end result is pretty underwhelming. You end up with a sanctuary that is filled with dust and fungus and doesn't have enough beds for everyone. It is an \n<br />unlivable living space, and this is after you poured all your money into fixing it up! \n<br />This is a mod that enhances the Dawnstar Sanctuary at the end of the DB questline with over [color=#c27ba0]7,000 endorsments![/color] I've gone though each section of the sanctuary and made the place have an air of realism; this is a sanctuary in a cold region (fireplaces and rugs) that a bunch of people are communally living in (they all have beds now). I've also added three new Dark Brotherhood NPC's (two of \n<br />which can be followers using VVE or [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74568/?][color=#c27ba0]RDO[/color][/url]), more storage space, more crafting stations, and a working shrine to Sithis.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c27ba0][font=impact][size=5]Installation Pre-Questline:[/size][/font][/color]\n<br />[list][*][size=2]Requires nothing extra.
