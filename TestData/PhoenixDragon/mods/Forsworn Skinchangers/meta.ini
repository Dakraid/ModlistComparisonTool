They are, essentially, Antler Bandits, and very little about how they fight sets them apart from any other enemy type.\n<br />This mod edits the Forsworn Berserker leveled lists so that after level 14, 1 out of every 3 enemies added to the list will be a skinchanger instead of a dual-wielder. Skinchangers have no normal weapons or spells, but when they enter combat, they will transform into a werewolf or werebear. These enemies are dangerous mini-bosses and should be treated as such.\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/52904][img]https://i.imgur.com/cET5e0Z.png[/img][/url][/center]"
