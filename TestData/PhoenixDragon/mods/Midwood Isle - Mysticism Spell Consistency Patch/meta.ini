nexusDescription="[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28120]Midwood Isle[/url] adds several new spells. Some of them are exactly the same as spells added by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839]Mysticism[/url]. This small patch replaces the spell tomes of the duplicate spells in Midwood Isle by their Mysticism counterparts. This way the player will have no way to access the duplicate spells, even though the spells (and their spell tomes) will still technically exist in the game.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Replaced spells (minor Midwood Isle spoilers):[/b]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Conjure Dremora Warlock\n<br />[*]Summon Spectral Bear - replaced by Conjure Spectral Bear.\xa0However, note that the NPCs can still cast Summon Spectral Bear (I didn't want to risk breaking anything by teaching the NPCs the Mysticism version).\n<br />[/list][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Not replaced spells (minor Midwood Isle spoilers):[/b]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]All \"resist\" spells - Mysticism has \"shell\" and \"shield\" spells that do the same thing, but they're stronger. So the \"resist\" spells from Midwood aren't duplicates strictly speaking\n<br />[*]Prolonged Healing - Mysticism has plenty of other healing spells, but none of them has exactly the magnitude and duration of Prolonged Healing, so I'm keeping it in, just for slightly more variety\n<br />[*]For some reason, Midwood Isle contains spell tomes that teach the player spells from the Dawnguard DLC. These are more expensive than the original Dawnguard tomes, but they teach the same spells. I assume that was intentional and so I kept them untouched.\n<br />[/list][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />The patch is just a minor xEdit plugin. I made it for people who don't know how to do this themselves (or don't want to bother).\n<br />\n<br />[i]Warning: This is\xa0[b]not[/b]\xa0\x63ompatible with my\xa0[/i][i][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63922]Midwood Isle - Wyrmstooth Spell Consistency Patch[/url]. There is one levelled list that both mods touch, so one will overwrite the other. If someone asks for it, I will make a version where they're compatible.[/i]"
