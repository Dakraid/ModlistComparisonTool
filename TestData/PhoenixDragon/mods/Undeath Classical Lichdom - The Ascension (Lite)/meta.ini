That said, I also love Classical Lichdom's gameplay enhancements, and didn't really want to choose between the two.\xa0 So I finally decided to not let my dreams be dreams, learn Papyrus, and make it happen. Several weeks of pain later, I bring you this mod!\n<br />\n<br />This mod is [b]not[/b] a port of all of Ascension's features/changes over to Classical Lichdom, hence the \"Ascension Lite\" moniker.\xa0 It ports the new lich armor/clothing variants, the dynamic outfit system, and the female lich models over from Ascension while keeping all of Classical Lichdom's systems intact.\xa0 I did however add a few new features and options not present in either mod, a full list of which are listed below.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#add8e6][size=5][b]Features[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#1e84cc][size=4][b]More variety[/b][/size][/color][b] - [/b][size=3]new lich skins for both skeletal and draugr-style liches, with color variations for each shroud type, including the new white shroud type added by Classical Lichdom.\xa0 In addition, all new lich variants can use the ethereal form added by Classical Lichdom.[/size]\n<br />[*][b][color=#1e84cc][size=4]Female Liches[/size][/color][/b][size=4]\xa0[/size][b]- [/b][size=3]All lich forms now have a female variant, including the Ayleid lich form added by The Cause. Requires Classical Lichdom's The Cause DLC addon. Note: The female Ayleid lich form is basically rigged up using Outfit Studio and tweaked until it looked decent. Its not a completely new model like the others, so keep that in mind.[/size]\n<br />[*][color=#1e84cc][size=4][b]Dynamic Outfit System[/b][/size][/color][b] - [/b][size=3]The[/size][size=3]\xa0\x66orm you take as a lich will depend on the cuirass you have equipped. Unique variants include wearing priest/mage robes to assume a dragon priest-style form, and wearing Miraak's robes to assume a form resembling his outfit. Full details are listed below. Works completely fine with Classical Lichdom's new customization system, and will keep the choices you make there intact. Speaking of which...[/size]\n<br />[*][size=4][b][color=#1e84cc]Reworked Customization System[/color][/b]\xa0- [/size][size=3]Don't like the dynamic outfit system? Turn it off in the MCM, and you'll be able to choose which armor variant you want explicitly at your phylactery. If its disabled before becoming a lich, you'll be asked to pick your armor variant after successfully completing the The Path of Transcendence.\xa0 If you turn it off after becoming a lich, you'll be given the last armor variant you had equipped while transformed until changed at your phylactery (unless using a Dragon Priest or Ayleid form).\xa0 Also of note, you can now pick a normal or skeletal dragon priest form when choosing that option at your phylactery regardless of if you have the dynamic outfit system enabled, with all shroud color variations available. The Miraak robe variant is unlockable after completing At the Summit of Apocrypha. (Note: customization still requires 25 souls as normal to unlock)[/size]\n<br />[*][b][color=#1e84cc][size=4]Masks[/size][/color] - [/b][size=3]All vanilla dragon priest masks are wearable in lich form, including Miraak and Konahrik.\xa0The Konahrik's Accoutrements and Legacy of the Dragonborn patches also let you wear the masks added by those mods in lich form as well.\xa0See below for details regarding This mod does not contain the hoodless variants of the dragon priest masks originally added by Ascension at the moment.\xa0[/size]\n<br />[*][b][color=#1e84cc][size=4]Vampire and Werewolf Options[/size] [/color][/b][size=3]- Toggleable features in the MCM that let you keep your vampire and werewolf forms when becoming a lich. These are off by default, but can be toggled on separately or both at the same time if you use another mod that lets you be a vampire and werewolf at the same time.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=4][color=#1e84cc][b]Cleaned and Optimized[/b][/color] [/size][size=3]all meshes and textures using CAO.\xa0 BC7, Mipmaps, etc. Meshes now fully optimized using SSE NIF Optimizer.[/size]\n<br />[*][color=#1e84cc][size=4][b]Optimized scripts[/b][/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4][b]\xa0[/b][size=3]as best as I could,[/size][/color][size=3]\xa0tried to reduce all laggy function calls to a minimum.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=5][b]Dynamic Outfit System - Details\n<br />[/b][/size][/color][size=3]As stated, the dynamic outfit system changes the form your lich assumes when transforming depending on the current cuirass (body slot 32) you have equipped. The current possible forms are as follows:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]No outfit equipped -&gt; Rags[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Clothing or Non-\"Priest\" Robes -&gt; Clothed[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Light Armor -&gt; Light Armor[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Heavy Armor -&gt; Heavy Armor[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]\"Priest\" Robes -&gt; Dragon Priest[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Miraak's Robes (any variant) -&gt; Miraak[/size]\n<br />[/list]A full list of valid mage/priest robes for the dragon priest variant can be found by clicking the spoiler tag below.\xa0 With the Konahrik's Accoutrements patch, or the composite Legacy of the Dragonborn patch, all KA dragon priest robes are also added to this list, as are Miraak's to his.\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[*][size=3]Arch-mage Robes\xa0(Hooded and Non-Hooded) + Replica with Legacy patch\xa0(1.41)\xa0[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Cultist Robes[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Expert Robes (Unenchanted and vanilla enchanted variants)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Greybeard Robes[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Master Robes (Unenchanted and vanilla enchanted variants)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Mythic Dawn Robes\xa0(Hooded and Non-Hooded)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Necromancer Robes[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Psijic Robes[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Telvanni Robes[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Temple Priest Robes[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Thalmor Robes (Hooded and Non-Hooded)[/size]\n<br />[*]Vaermina Robes\n<br />[*]Legacy - Visage Robes (Armor of Morihaus) + Replica\n<br />[/spoiler]\xa0\n<br />[/size][color=#add8e6][size=5][b]Compatibility\n<br />[/b][/size][/color][size=3]This mod will be compatible with any mod that doesn't edit Undeath, the dragon priest's skeleton, or the vanilla Dragon Priest Masks.

Load this mod after Classical Lichdom. The new female Ayleid Lich variant requires The Cause CC and Undeath Classical Lichdom's patch for it.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This mod and all its patches are in the ESP-FE (light esp) format.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=lightblue][size=5][b]Known Issues[/b]\n<br />[/size][/color][size=3]There is a small graphical issue on the male Skeletal Dragon Priest model where it has a piece of the original dragon priest foot mesh attached to the bottom of the foot.\xa0 This was an issue retained from the original Ascension mod.\xa0\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Update instructions for 1.2+ below for solving the missing MCM issue:\n<br />[spoiler] I reproduced the MCM issue on my end, and spent a few hours messing around with the script and the CK, and was able to get it working.\xa0 One issue I did run into was on saves running the broken script, it did not update and kept all the old values that needed to be fixed.\xa0 There are a handful of solutions to this issue:\n<br />1) Start a new game.\n<br />2) Load a save game before update 1.2 or Ascension was installed\n<br />3) Get\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031/]Resaver[/url]\xa0, open your most recent save. In the top left corner there will be a box to search/filter by script.\xa0 Type \"NecroUCLAMCMScript\" without quotes.\xa0 It will show a few folders. Expand the one that says \"Script Instances\" all the way.\xa0 When fully expanded, right click on the \"NecroUCLAMCMScript\" instance, and select \"Delete (1 Element)\".\xa0 Go to the file menu, Save As, and save it in your Skyrim Special Edition save folder, preferably with a new name, but it will keep backups of old saves.\xa0 If you did everything right, it should now load the MCM menu.\n<br />\n<br />Sorry the solutions either cause you to lose progress or are a bit technical, but its a side effect of scripts getting baked in save files.\xa0 If after all that you still have issues with the MCM on 1.23, let me know.\n<br />\n<br />Manual console commands for changing the MCM settings preserved just in case:\n<br />Toggle Outfit System: \"set\xa0NecroLichOutfitChangeSystemActive to 0\" , 1 to re-enable\n<br />Toggle Vampires: \"set NecroLichAllowVampires to 1\" , 0 for disable\n<br />Toggle Werewolves:\xa0\"set\xa0NecroLichAllowWerewolves to 1\" , 0 for disable [/spoiler]\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=lightblue][size=5][b]Permissions\n<br />[/b][/size][/color][size=3]Since this mod includes the work of multiple authors, permissions can get a bit murky. Anything using assets from the original\xa0Undeath mod or Classical Lichdom should be fine, given their open permissions.\xa0 Myst requires you to get permission from them to use their assets from Ascension, so please direct inquiries regarding their use to them.\xa0 You are free to use any of my edited scripts, and I have provided (and commented!) the source code I used. You have full permission to release patches or fixes to this mod [b]provided[/b] it does not redistribute Myst's work without their permission, [b]and[/b]\xa0you agree to take on full support for the changes you make. The two vanilla models I edited (the female Ayleid lich and hoodless dragon priest Konahrik mask) are free to use. Translations of the mod are also fine provided they obey the conditions above.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=lightblue][size=5][b]Credits\n<br />[/b][/size][/color][size=3]This mod wouldn't be possible if not for the work of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/2125204?tab=user+files&amp;BH=1]Myst42[/url], the original author of Undeath - The Ascension, who graciously gave me permission to port it.
