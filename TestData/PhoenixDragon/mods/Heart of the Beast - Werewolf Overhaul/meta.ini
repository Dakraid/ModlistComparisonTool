By the game guide, werewolves are faster then horses. \r<br />But this is not true - you can tell when modding, the numbers dont lie (werewolves are exactly 12% slower then horses)\r<br /> - With this mod, the werewolves can now run as free and as fast as a wild stallion - teach those damn deer that you are far worse then any common wolf&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[size=3]WALKING SPEED increased by 30%[/size] \r<br /> - Not that you will ever walk around in your werewolf form, but if you happen to try it, now you can do it a little bit faster&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]TAKE NOTE THAT THIS IS THE OPTIONAL PART OF THE MOD, AND MAY CONFLICT WITH MOST MODS THE SOUNDS ARE FINE WITH&#33;[/size] \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://oi61.tinypic.com/27wwymu.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ff7700]USE MY MOD WITH THE FOLLOWING MODS FOR THE BEST EFFECT AND BEST EXPERIENCE AS A WEREWOLF[/color] - please don&#39;t forget to endorse the authors of these impressive projects (Note that these mods are fully tested for compatibility)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35470]Moonlight Tales - Werewolf and Werebear Overhaul[/url][/size]\r<br />- This awesome new mod by Brevi/Spwned (The creator of Tales of Lycanthropy) is basically an enhanced version of Tales of Lycanthropy plus my mod \r<br />( minus the sounds) - It contains all my retextures and 4 glowing eye models, in addition it also contains werebear transformations and a TON of options for easy customization, including how to make your own wolf form unique&#33;

It allows the player to smell the world, become and live as an Alpha werewolf and the ability to gather and command a wolf/werewolf pack. In addition it allows you to transform into a monstrous lizard similar to a were-dovah.\r<br />[size=4][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16846]Bloody Cannibalism[/url][/size]\r<br />- This mod makes feeding a bit more fun - you rip apart the body and leave a heap of bones and blood on the floor - a bit unrealistic, but very fun\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://oi58.tinypic.com/vxoilf.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />- I will need feedback from you guys on this one but I have tested it alongside some other mods\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ff7700]SOUND FILES[/color]     - Will directly overwrite any other werewolf sound files (even ToL sounds)[/size]\r<br />[size=4][color=#ff7700]TEXTURE FILES[/color]   - Will directly overwrite any other werewolf textures[/size]\r<br />[size=4][color=#ff7700]SPEED FILE[/color]        - Will conflict with other werewolf speed enhancing mods[/size]\r<br />\r<br />- The speed will conflict with [size=3][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6622]Advanced Legendary Werewolves[/url][/size], however if my mod is placed first in the load order, it only seems to shut off the speed part of the advanced werewolf mod\r<br />- The mod works perfectly along with [size=3][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12687]Tales of Lycanthropy - Werewolf Overhaul[/url][/size] but my sounds will overwrite all his sounds until removed\r<br />[size=3]- take note that my shout sound will replace all his shouts, so if you want his shouts just open the data/sound/fx/npc/werewolf and delete the[/size]  [size=4][b]npc_werewolf_shout_01[/b][/size] [size=3]sound&#33;[/size] \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://oi61.tinypic.com/rmiik4.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]1.0[/size] - Your werewolf can now truly howl and scare enemies to death with the new sounds&#33;\r<br />[size=3]1.1[/size] - Now with the option to increase speed, your werewolf will run faster then ever before&#33;\r<br />[size=3]1.2[/size] - Tweaked the speed a bit - upped the running speed by 5% more (now 15% more then vanilla) and increased the sprint speed from 10% to 15% to outmatch the speed of horses\r<br />- also solved the weird bug where running sideways would trigger the sprint speed\r<br />[size=3]1.3[/size]- Added a lot more sounds including the shout, transformation, finishing moves and attacks\r<br />[size=3]1.4[/size] - Added a new sound set named FERAL WEREWOLF, that offers a more aggressive and brutal experience as a werewolf\r<br />[size=3]1.5[/size] - Mod renamed to HEART OF THE BEAST after multiple complaints about the previous title\r<br />[size=3]1.5[/size] - Added a new sound set named ALPHA WEREWOLF, the most horrific version yet\r<br />[size=3]1.5[/size] - Optional eye textures used in the upcoming Legend of Cain episodes are now available for download\r<br />[size=3]1.6[/size] - Werewolf eye textures replaced with a new improved version - werewolves will now look straight instead of sideways\r<br />[size=3]1.6[/size] - Mod updated with werewolf textures used in the upcoming Legend of Cain episodes - the textures are now a main part of the mod instead optional\r<br />[size=3]1.7[/size] - An updated mesh for glowing eyes has been released, available for both the default and the &#39;&#39;Howling&#39;&#39; werewolf model from tales of lycanthropy\r<br />[size=3]1.7[/size] - A fix for the &#39;&#39;glowing white orbs&#39;&#39; present by default on the eyes is now available for download\r<br />[size=3]1.8[/size] - Updated and improved body and eye textures have been released, fixing previous mistakes like too brightly colored hands and improving the quality and color of the eyes.
