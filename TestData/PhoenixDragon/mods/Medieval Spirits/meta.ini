nexusDescription="Content: \n<br />18scratch made models , replacing all alcohol related objects of the Skyrim world. This includes common, spiced and firebrand wine bottles (plus a wooden case as quest item replacer) and also common, black brier and black brier special reserve mead bottles. \n<br />\n<br />Style: \n<br />Medieval, worn, with a touch of fantasy, textured with materials that match the time and place.\n<br />\n<br />Compatibility:\n<br />Probably compatible with everything, as long as this mod is given priority, or overwrite, depending on the mod manager you prefer. \n<br />\n<br />Performance:\n<br />All models are low poly, around 2 x bethesda polycount, and will have no performance impact\n<br />\n<br />Textures:\n<br />2k diffuse / normal map \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED INTERIOR REPLACERS\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23552]Skyrim 3D Furniture[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20829]Skyrim 3D Misc[/url] (Barrels and Dining Set)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23938]Medieval Silverware[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u]FAQ[/u]\n<br />[i]I like object A but i dont like object B.
