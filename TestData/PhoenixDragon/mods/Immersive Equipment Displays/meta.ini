nexusDescription="[size=5][center]Feature highlights[/center][/size][size=3]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Display every piece of equipment on the player or NPCs, at once\xa0- 1h/2h swords and axes, maces, daggers, staves, bows, crossbows, shields and torches.\xa0\n<br />[*]Display almost any item found in the game - misc, potions, scrolls, soul gems, ingredients, books, keys, even static objects - if it exists in your LO, you can make it into a display.\n<br />[*]Highly configurable gear positioning system for\xa0[u]equipped and displayed[/u]\xa0gear with conditional offsets to prevent clipping/gaps. Supports weight/armor adjusts for each node separately.\xa0\n<br />[*]In-game UI for setting up everything in real time - create custom item displays, reposition gear, tweak settings on equipment displays and more\xa0without ever leaving the game. Changes take effect immediately.\n<br />[*]Import/export presets - never lose your setup when starting a new game and easily share it with the community.\n<br />[*]Fine-tune your setup - each actor, npc and race can have an unique configuration set. For example you can change positions for certain npcs, setup the correct nodes for creature races so that displays show up, attach battering rams to chickens, etc..\xa0\n<br />[*]Conditional equipment display overrides - apply different settings to displays when certain conditions are met. One of many uses for this feature is to move and neatly arrange gear on an equipped backpack.\n<br />[*]Papyrus interface for modders\n<br />[*]Support for translations (UI)\n<br />[/list][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5]Installation[/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />This plugin does [b]NOT [/b]need the full XPMSSE package to work, only the skeleton meshes which are included in it. These can also be found in 'XPMSSE Left Hand Sheath Rotation Fix'\xa0under Simple Dual Sheath optional files so it's enough to install just that. \n<br />\n<br />FNIS/Nemesis, RaceMenu, or the XPMSSE .esp + scripts are [b]NOT [/b]required by this plugin or Simple Dual Sheath.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Prerequisites:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE64[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444]Address Library for SKSE Plugins[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988]XPMSSE\xfeff[/url]\xa0(only the skeleton meshes are required, read above)\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50049]Simple Dual Sheath[/url]\xa0(required to show\xa0[u][b]equipped[/b][/u] left hand weapons, staves and for the ability to have the shield equipped on back. I recommend installing the rotation fix from optional files as well)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />Install the main file manually or with your preferred mod manager.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5]Getting started[/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />\xa0\x41\x66ter installation there's not much to be done if these default settings are fine for you:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]All player and NPC equipment displays enabled (player must have the item favorited).[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]NPC equipment displays turn off if they're not wearing armor.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Gear positions (equipped and displayed) setup in an adaptive way where offsets are applied based on what's equipped to minimize clipping and floating items. Weight and armor adjusts are applied to all items, including left hand weapons and shield.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />You can make changes in the UI, press\xa0[b]Backspace[/b] (default) to bring it up. Note that the UI [b]will not open in paused in-game menus\xa0[/b](this includes the main and inventory menus) unless\xa0[b]EnableInMenus=true[/b] in the INI.\xa0The default config mentioned above is used when starting a new game, after that the entire configuration, including any changes you make during the playthrough, is [b]stored the SKSE co-save[/b].\n<br />\n<br />[u][i]Important if you use XPMSSE styles (otherwise you can skip this)[/i][/u]:\n<br />\n<br />Styles in this plugin should be configured to match what you've got in XPMSSE MCM. This is necessary because:\n<br />\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*][size=3]XPMSSE only applies styles once an item is equipped and only to that equipment type.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3][s]IED can't switch animations on its own, you need the XPMSSE plugin for that functionality.\xa0[/s][/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Bring up the UI with\xa0[b]Backspace[/b]\xa0(default).\xa0Go to View-&gt;Gear positioning, select Global tab, select 'Placement' radio button. Set the positions to match what you have in XPMSSE MCM. Pay attention to what you're editing, placements are set individually for player (male/female) and NPC (male/female) [[url=https://i.imgur.com/IfK5g8n.png]pic[/url]]. You can copy-paste the entire placement config set via the Actions menu.\n<br />\n<br />Versions 1.5.0 and newer have support for alternate animations (aka style-fitting animations), enable it in the UI (Tools-&gt;Settings). Behavior data needs to be generated with FNIS, but you don't have to enable FNIS.esp for the sake of this plugin. Does not work with Nemesis.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5]UI[/size][/center]\n<br />[size=3]If you have issues opening the UI, configure your keys in the ini (ToggleKeys) and set\xa0OverrideToggleKeys=true. Keep in mind it can't be opened in a paused menu unless you set\xa0\x45nableInMenus=true in the INI.\n<br />\n<br />This is just some basic stuff about the layout, I'll write an article with more details later.[/size]\n<br />[size=4][url=https://imgur.com/a/itS3kUs]\n<br />Import/export[/url]\xa0(File menu):[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Save/load parts or the entire configuration.

Gear positioning presets\xa0include both position and node placement.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5]Known issues[/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Scabbard straps on weapons displayed on the [b]left [/b]side stick out after installing 'XPMSSE Left Hand Sheath Rotation Fix' optional file from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50049/?tab=description]Simple Dual Sheath[/url].

Zip contents of the output folder and install it with your mod manager (place at the end of your load order).[/size]\n<br />[/list][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5]Compatibility[/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]If you use the XPMSSE racemenu plugin (or another plugin) to position your gear, turn it off and use this instead (navigate to View-&gt;Gear positioning). There's no hard conflict but the other plugin might clobber dynamic weapon position adjustments on actors. XPMSSE sets positions through skee64 (nioverride) and these settings may linger in the save even after the XPMSSE racemenu plugin is removed. They are applied after 3D loads so it may clobber IED positions after a race switch (for example after werewolf/vampire transformations).\xa0\xa0[/size]\n<br />[*]A compatible (XP32) skeleton is required. Be careful with mods which overwrite races with custom skeletons.\n<br />[*]Not compatible with other mods which display unequipped gear (you'd see duplicate items)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5]Credits[/size][/center][size=3][center]\n<br />SKSE team and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5687342]Fudgyduff[/url] (CommonLib)\n<br />[url=https://github.com/ocornut]ocornut[/url] for [url=https://github.com/ocornut/imgui]ImGui[/url]\n<br />[url=https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp]jsoncpp[/url]\n<br />[url=https://github.com/boostorg]boost[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2623377]SteveTownsend[/url] for coming up with a solution to the left-hand weapon scabbard problem\n<br />\n<br />Source is on [url=https://github.com/SlavicPotato/ied-dev]GitHub[/url][/center]\n<br />[/size]"
