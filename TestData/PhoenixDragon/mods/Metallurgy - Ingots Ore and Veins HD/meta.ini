nexusDescription="[size=5]ABOUT[/size]\n<br />All-new, hand-crafted HD textures for all ingots, ore, and ore veins/deposits, featuring new ingot meshes. Vanilla-styled. 2K &amp; 1K options.\n<br />\n<br />I know there are a handful of replacers out there, but I wanted to put my own spin on Skyrim's crafting materials.\xa0 I kept the vanilla art style very close for the most part, but added a little bit of flair and some detail from their real-world counterparts.\xa0 For example, Ebony in Skyrim is a volcanic glass, and as such, it now looks a little bit more like volcanic obsidian.\n<br />\n<br />All base game ores, ingots, and ore veins/deposits are covered.\xa0 The gem/geode veins in Dragonborn use the same textures, so those are covered as well.\xa0 Heart Stone veins have their own brand-new texture, and the Heart Stone \"ingot\" object has received a high quality AI upscale.\n<br />\n<br />New meshes were created for the ingots, as the base game meshes had broken surface normals from triangulation (resulting in hard 'cuts' and angled lines that distort the surfaces.)\xa0 As such, my new ingot meshes are a bit less worn looking than the vanilla models, as I opted to make them look more \"freshly made.\"\n<br />\n<br />Normal maps are saved with BC7 compression to minimize artifacts.\n<br />\n<br />The collision sound for ingots has also been properly assigned in the mesh.\xa0 In the vanilla game they use the \"medium boulder\" impact sound, which made them sound like they weighed 500lbs.\xa0 They have all been changed to use metal solid, so they sound more like an iron pot being dropped.\n<br />\n<br />Please note: These make heavy use of environment maps (reflections.) I have custom environment maps, so your game may look a little different than what is pictured in the screenshots.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58817]My personal cubemaps are available here.[/url]\n<br />\n<br />All screenshots are in-game or NIFSkope.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]COMPATIBILITY\n<br />[/size]Not compatible with other ingot / ore replacers.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]INSTALLATION\n<br />[/size]Choose 1k or 2k, packed or loose.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]PACKED: Files are packed into BA2 archives, and use an ESL-flagged ESP as a \"dummy\" loader.\xa0 For those who have a clean load order with packed files, simply make sure this loads later in your load order.\n<br />[*]LOOSE: For those who use mod managers which barf loose files everywhere and require individual file overrides, you can grab the loose options in the Optional Files section\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5]TOOLS USED[/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Blender 2.79\n<br />[*]3DS Max 2013\n<br />[*]NifUtils\n<br />[*]NIFSkope\n<br />[*]Substance Painter\n<br />[*]Adobe Photoshop + Intel DDS Plugin\n<br />[/list]"
