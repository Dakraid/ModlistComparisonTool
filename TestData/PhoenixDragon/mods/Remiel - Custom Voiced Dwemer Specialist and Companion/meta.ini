nexusDescription="[b]Overview:\n<br />[/b]\n<br />Remiel is a Breton Dwemer specialist. She hails from Wayrest, and having explored her fill of the dwemer ruins in High Rock, she has moved on to explore Skyrim. The only problem is, she's not much of a fighter, and will need your help to see all that Skyrim has in store for her. \n<br />\n<br />She is custom-voiced with approximately 2500 lines of dialogue. She is aware of the cities and towns of Skyrim, of various weathers, and of the times of day. She works off a custom follower framework, which means that similarly to Inigo, for example, using NFF, AFT, etc. will most likely confuse her. You're free to try to manage her with such frameworks, but I haven't tested them myself and I won't be able to help if she does break.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />You can find Remi staying at Markarth's Silverblood Inn, where she is staying after having been turned away from Nchuand-Zel, the ruins under the city. You can offer your aid in gaining entrance to the ancient dwemer city, embarking on a mini-quest that follows along with the vanilla quest \"The Lost Expedition.\" During this quest, Remi will obtain her dwemer spider and become a \"full\" follower, unlocking various discussion topics, quest dialogue, idle commentary, and a regard system.\n<br />\n<br />Remiel's spider, Scrap, can be upgraded. After completing her initial quest, you will be prompted to take Remi exploring with you, and after seeing a number of dwemer ruins in your travels, she will begin making improvements. A detailed explanation can be found below.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Skills:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />While Remi will rely on you and Scrap to see her through dungeons safely, she has other skills that may prove useful to you. \n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Thievery comes naturally to her, and if you hand her some lockpicks, she's sure to make quick work of any doors in your way. Being physically weak, she's also learned to try and get by her foes unnoticed, giving her experience in stealth and avoiding traps.\xa0\n<br />[*]A tendency to experiment lends itself toward potion-brewing. She may not have formal training in alchemy, but she's brave enough to eat strange ingredients and throw them into potions, just to see what may be created. Her potions may be useful... or they may not. That's for you to discover.\n<br />[*]While Remi's areas of knowledge tend toward the mechanical, she is a Breton, after all, and so has an innate ability with magic. Although she never quite got the hang of the more advanced magics, she can keep her health up. If you become a close enough friend, maybe she'll even use her restoration spells for you.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Voice Samples:\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[url=https://soundcloud.com/sarah-craig-181643461/intro1][b]Intro1[/b][/url][url=https://soundcloud.com/sarah-craig-181643461/intro1]\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[url=http://https://soundcloud.com/sarah-craig-181643461/intro2]\xfeffIntro2\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[b][url=https://soundcloud.com/sarah-craig-181643461/intro3]Intro3[/url]\n<br />\n<br />More In-depth on her Features:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler][i]Regard:[/i]\xa0Remi currently has a very simplistic regard system. She will begin neutral, and depending on your responses to various discussions you have with her, she may like you more or less as time goes on. I won't go into details, but in essence, if you are mean to her, she won't like you very much! Bretons also have a complicated history with the Altmer and the Nords, and this will show in some of her views. This doesn't mean that she'll hate you for being a Nord or an Altmer, but she will start out with some misgivings about those cultures. She is wary of the Stormcloaks, but if you have a discussion with her about why you've chosen to fight for Ulfric (and aren't mean about it), she will come to an understanding with you.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Potions: [/i]If you ask Remi about herself, you may learn that she brews potions on occasion. After talking with her about this, you will be able to ask her for some sample potions in safe places (i.e., Inns, Player Homes). She is self-taught, so her potions tend to be a little wonky. These potions have the base vanilla effect in addition to a strong secondary effect but also a costly third effect. Give them a try. :) After all, she's worked hard on them.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Upgrading Scrap: [/i]Each dwemer ruin Remi sees will give her some inspiration in how she programs her dwemer spider. How strong Scrap is depends on how many of these ruins she has seen. By default, Scrap starts at \"Level 1\".\xa0\n<br />\n<br />1-Basic Dwemer Spider, levels at a rate of 0.8 with the PC\n<br />2-Increased Attack Strength, levels at a rate of 0.8 with the PC\n<br />3-Adds the Dwemer Spider lightning attack, levels at a rate of 0.9 with the PC\n<br />4-Increased Attack Strength, levels at a rate of 0.9 with the PC\n<br />5-Adds the Dwemer steam attack, levels at a rate of 1.0 with PC\n<br />\n<br />The locations that will count toward this quest include:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Mzulft\n<br />[*]Alftand\n<br />[*]Ikrngthand\n<br />[*]Kagrenzel\n<br />[*]Avanchnzel\n<br />[*]Bthardamz\n<br />[*]The Aetherium Forge\n<br />[*]Mzinchale\n<br />[*]Raldbthar\n<br />[*]Arkngthamz\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[i]Healing:[/i]\xa0\x41\x66ter you reach a high level of friendship with Remi, she will offer to heal you in battle. If you reach less than 40% health, she will attempt to patch you up.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Set Home: [/i]Can tell Remi to live in any Inn or Player Home, and she will return there to sandbox after being dismissed.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Relax: [/i]If you're getting your busywork done, melting down all that dwarven metal for ingots, and you're tired of Remi drilling holes into the back of your head as you work, you can tell her to relax. She will remain within the general vicinity you asked her to relax in and get her own busywork done. She'll only relax in places that are safe to relax in (inns, player homes, towns, and cities). If you're feeling kind, you can bring her a drink while you guys unwind.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Projects: [/i]If you are good enough friends with her, Remi might talk about projects that she is working on and ask for your help. While relaxing, see if she seems to be thinking about anything to trigger her first project. Currently, only one project exists, but more will be added in future updates.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Horse Riding: [/i]You can ask Remi to ride her horse. Keep in mind that she can't follow you into cities while riding, so have her dismount if you're heading into town.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Lockpicking: [/i]Remiel can pick locked doors, so long as they aren't load doors. If asked, she will give a way to command her to unlock doors that overrides the \"command\" function. Stand directly in front of the door you'd like her to unlock and cast the command.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Marriage: [/i]Complete the \"Upgrades\" quest and/or hear Remi talk about her history with her father and with her previous relationship. This will allow the player to start \"flirting\" with her, with a dialogue option aptly named 'flirt.' Each option in this category will award a set number of points toward setting her as a marriage candidate, with 12 points being the minimum for marrying her. You'll know you've reached this because Remi will have force-greeted you four times to 'flirt' back. At this point, the marriage proceeds according to vanilla. After marriage, Remi will have some unique idles, will make you meals, will run a \"store,\" and can be given gifts. She'll also banter with your kids.\n<br /> [/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Interactions:\n<br />\n<br />[/b][spoiler]\n<br />[u]Vanilla Followers[/u]\n<br />\n<br />[i]Teldryn Sero: [/i]~70 lines, 9 Banters\n<br />[i]Aela the Huntress: [/i]~80 lines, 13 Banters\n<br />[i]Serana: [/i]~100 lines, 9 Banters\n<br />[i]Meeko: [/i]~10 lines, 2 \"Banters\" (Can one banter with a dog?)\n<br />[i]J'zargo: [/i]~60 lines; 7 Banters\n<br />\n<br />[u]Modded Followers\n<br />\n<br />[/u][i][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44967/]Lucifer[/url]: [/i]~100 lines\n<br />[i][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58979]Thogra[/url]*: [/i]~140 lines\n<br />[i][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62893/]Xelzaz[/url]: [/i]~950 lines\n<br />[i][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40122]Khash[/url]: [/i]In Progress :)\n<br />[i][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278]Auri[/url]:\xa0 [/i]~250 lines\n<br />\n<br />*Requires Patch\n<br />\n<br />[u]Other Mods\n<br />\n<br />[/u][i][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41856]I'm Glad You're Here[/url][/i]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Quest Commentary:\n<br />\n<br />[/b][spoiler]\n<br />[u]Vanilla Quests\n<br />[/u]\n<br />[i]Lost to the Ages[/i]\n<br />[i]College of Winterhold, including side quests[/i]\n<br />[i]Thieves' Guild[/i]\n<br />[i]Main Quest[/i]\n<br />[i]Dragonborn DLC, including side quests[/i]\n<br />[i]Companions[/i]\n<br />[i]Dawnguard\n<br />The Dark Brotherhood\n<br />Ill Met By Moonlight\n<br />Boethiah's Calling\n<br />The Black Star\n<br />A Daedra's Best Friend\n<br />Unfathomable Depths[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[u]Modded Quests\n<br />\n<br />[/u][i]Beyond Reach: [/i]In Progress\n<br />[i]Legacy of the Dragonborn: [/i]In Progress\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b]TL;DR:[/b]\n<br />[u]Race[/u]: Breton\n<br />[u]Location[/u]: Markarth, Silverblood Inn\n<br />[u]Voice[/u]: Custom Voicing OR Female Even-toned\n<br />[u]Skills[/u]: Conjuration (As Scrap is technically a summon), Lightfoot, Apprentice Locks, Stealth 40\n<br />\n<br />[b]Downloads:[/b]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Main File 1: Custom Voiced, Custom Framework, 2500 lines of dialogue, Custom Looks\n<br />[*]Optional File 1: Patch for banter with Thogra gra-Mugur\n<br />[*]Optional File 2: Vanilla Female Even-Toned Voice Type, Vanilla Framework, no quests, just Remi and her spider\n<br />[*]Optional File 3: Patch to have her use Vanilla looks\n<br />[*]Old File 1: Version 1.4.2 for those with the bug where she wanders away after reloading a save\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Requirements:\n<br />   \xfeff\n<br />[/b]None except the DLCs\n<br />\n<br />[b]Instructions:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Download one of the two downloads with your favourite mod manager.
