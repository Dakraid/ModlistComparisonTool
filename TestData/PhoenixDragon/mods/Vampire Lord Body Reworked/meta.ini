nexusDescription="2.0 High Poly Version:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45347]Vamp Lord 2.0[/url]\n<br />\n<br />First things first, have to give thanks to the creators of Bodyslide and Outfit Studio for this one, Link is here: Bodyslide[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49015]\xa0\x61nd Outfit Studio[/url]\n<br />\n<br />(In Pictures left is the before photo right side is the after)\n<br />\n<br />This will make your vampire lord look like you are actually fresh to being a vampire versus looking like one that's all dried up and been sucking on dead camel blood. I formed his body to be more slim around the waist and to have younger looking muscle tone. The face has been completely reformed by hand... or ahh.. mouse and pointer?.. but yeah, I toned down the weird looking neck muscles and made his collar bones closer to his neck to look more realistic, and finally I toned up his legs just a bit.\n<br />\n<br />If you are using another mod that retextures the vampire lord, load it after this one.\n<br />\n<br />Not compatable with any mods that directly change the Vampire lords body model\n<br />It is compatible with mods that change the skeleton\n<br />MO2: Always place Vampire texture and armor mods after this one in your left pane.\n<br />\n<br />My other Mods:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40912]\n<br />Vial Of Ustengrav[/url]\xfeff: Boss Mod\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40855]Dragon Bone Chest ReTexture[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40842]Markarth for Potatoes[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40840]Windhelm For Potatoes[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30944]Slayers Ghost Weapons Redone[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30573]Dragon Soul Shields[/url]"
