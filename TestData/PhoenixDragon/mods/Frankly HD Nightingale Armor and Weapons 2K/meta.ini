nexusDescription="[center][size=5][b][color=#8e7cc3]Frankly HD Nightingale Armor and Weapons[/color][/b]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=2][i]\"Our trinity serves the Lady Nocturnal, the Empress of Murk and the Daughter of Twilight\"[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#8e7cc3]High resolution (4k and 2k available)[/color][/b] retexture of Nightingale weapons and armor. Crafted with emphasis on the fact that this is a set of equipment that is passed through generations of Nightingales, hence the [b][color=#8e7cc3]heavy weathering on the black leather[/color][/b]. And it's the equipment of a daedric cult which makes the use of [b][color=#8e7cc3]ebony decorations[/color][/b] quite fitting.\n<br />\n<br />Vanilla normal maps were upscaled with a neural network software leading to much\xa0[b][color=#8e7cc3]crisper and clearer details[/color][/b]\xa0than one normally gets with upscaling on traditional image editing software.\n<br />\n<br />Meshes had to be modified to assign a new cubemap for the ebony details. This can present compatibility issues with mods modifying the meshes. Therefore, I'm offering [color=#8e7cc3][b]two mesh optionals: capeless and full glove[/b][/color] for those that don't like the vanilla fingerless ones. Contrary to the above, it is [color=#8e7cc3][b]compatible with mods modifying the cowl's mesh[/b][/color] such as\xa0Improved Closefaced Helmets.\xa0There's also a [color=#8e7cc3][b]texture\xa0variant with less saturated leather weathering[/b][/color].\n<br />\n<br />In addition, the[b][color=#8e7cc3] Nightingale Blade\xa0[/color][/b]model has been [color=#8e7cc3][b]improved in both polycount and proportions[/b][/color], it's much thinner and practical than vanilla. And it has a [b][color=#8e7cc3]unique custom scabbard[/color][/b] made to fit the set with a crescent moon as it's chape.\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://www.mediafire.com/convkey/48b4/7t5241ei61f6madzg.jpg[/img]\xfeff[/size][/size][/center]"
