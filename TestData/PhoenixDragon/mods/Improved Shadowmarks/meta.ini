Now you can inform fellow thieves of your status in the Guild, while simultaneously protecting your house and property from any unwanted visitors.  This mod has no practical effect on gameplay or any other function in the game.  It is solely a cosmetic change for roleplaying purposes.  \n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][color=#cccccc][size=6]F[/size][size=5]EATURES[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[list][*] Adds shadowmarks to player-owned homes, including\xa0Hearthfire homes and Severin Manor\n<br />[*]Shadowmarks automatically adjust to reflect the player's current status within the Guild and the ownership status of the home\n<br />[*] Improves the positions of existing shadowmarks\n<br />[*] Adds shadowmarks to a number of locations that were missing them\n<br />[*] Updates certain shadowmarks based on completed quests (East Empire Company Office in Windhelm, Riften Warehouse, etc)\n<br />[*] Improves the appearance of the shadowmarks by reducing their shine and smoothing out their jagged edges (using plugin edits)\n<br />[*] New textures further improve the appearance of the shadowmarks\n<br />[/list][line]\n<br />[font=Georgia][color=#cccccc][size=5][size=6]I[/size]NSTALLATION[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />Download and install one of the main file options using your preferred mod manager, or manually extract the .zip file to the Skyrim Special Edition/Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Texture Only Options:[/b] There is also the option to install only the new textures, without any of the other changes.
