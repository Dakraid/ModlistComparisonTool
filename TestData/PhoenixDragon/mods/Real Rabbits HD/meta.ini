nexusDescription="[b]Update 6/24/2021: Now with fuzzy fur shells!\xa0 See gallery for details.\xa0 High-poly mesh now standard.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />While updating the animals in my game, I was surprised that there weren't nearly as many options for Rabbit textures as there are other creatures.\xa0 For fun and practice I thought I'd whip up a few.\n<br />\n<br />Real Rabbits HD adds new high-resolution textures and higher-poly mesh with fuzzy fur shells, while keeping close to the vanilla colors and art style.\xa0 It also adds 5 extra colors, with an extremely light-weight \"skin randomizer\" so all the rabbits in your game will look different (see Technical Details for more information.)\n<br />\n<br />[b]INSTALLATION[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Grab the fuzzy version if you want the fuzzy fur shells (4x poly count due to technique)\n<br />[*]Grab the standard version in optional files if poly count is a concern\n<br />[*][color=#9fc5e8][b]MAKE SURE THIS MOD OVERWRITES ALL RABBIT MESHES, ESPECIALLY SMIM, OR YOU WILL HAVE CONFLICTS RESULTING IN TEXTURE STRETCHING.[/b][/color]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]TECHNICAL DETAILS[/b]\n<br />The rabbit is one of the few animals that is hand-placed directly all over the map, and is part of multiple leveled lists.\xa0 To avoid conflicts, I use a very simple method:\xa0 A new ability spell is on the HareRace that randomly equips one of the skins when they spawn.\xa0 It is extremely lightweight, and is similar to how Automatic Variants used to work for LE, if you're familiar.\xa0 Being an ability at the race level, you'll need to make sure the plugin is lower in your load order to avoid any conflicts.\xa0 For more information see the [b]Frequently Asked Questions sticky post.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]COMPATIBILITY\n<br />[/b]Mods that use the vanilla HareRace will automatically use these textures.\xa0 Mods that completely change the mesh and use a different UV mapping than vanilla will not be compatible.\n<br />\n<br />This is not compatible with the SMIM rabbit mesh, but being high poly itself, it is not needed.\xa0 Make sure it loads after SMIM.\xa0 This does not alter the hanging\xa0 harvestable rabbit.\n<br />\n<br />However, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55543]Static Mesh Improvement Mod Improvement Mod (2021)[/url], which updates some SMIM models, now has a patch for Real Rabbits HD!\n<br />\n<br />[b]TOOLS USED[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]3DS Max 2013\n<br />[*]NifTools Plugin\n<br />[*]Substance Painter\n<br />[*]Adobe Photoshop\n<br />[*]Creation Kit\n<br />[*]SSE Archive\n<br />[*]NifSkope\n<br />[*]SSE Nif Optimizer\n<br />[/list]"
