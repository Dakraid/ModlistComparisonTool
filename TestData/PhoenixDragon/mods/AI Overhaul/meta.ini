And no not sandbox one area they really could be doing anything. They may be at different parts of the city,\xa0Shopping\xa0or at home.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />- Not every NPC will randomly greet you. I mean not everyone I walk by in my life stops to greet me.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />- NPCs interact more with the environment around them. They may read a letter or book, search containers, drink, eat, observe, etc.\n<br />\n<br />-If a family member dies, the surviving family member(s) will visit their grave.\n<br />\n<br />-Spousal freedom in walled cities.

See Doc\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Troubleshooting[/size]:[/b]\n<br />If you experience issues with movement and lip syncing be aware that in some cases (especially with population mods) too many NPCs will go over\n<br />the limit of AI working correctly in a cell. Examples: NPC\x2019s Standing still,\n<br />NPCs floating, NPCs face frozen. By default this number is 20, I changed that\n<br />to 30.\n<br />Recommend mod if you exceed that limit: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6270/.popup-topic?tab=posts]Increase Actors in a cell[/url]\xa0or\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32349]Actor Limit Fix[/url]\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />NPCs do nothing after they were in a scene. \x2013Reset AI or \"RecycleActor\xa0then Resurrect\x201d them using the console command to refresh them.\n<br />\n<br />Most common problem this mod has are conflicts with other mods that usually have edited NPCs or AI, and most of the time this mod will often get mixed up with third party conflicts, so again make sure all your mods work in harmony (for the most part).\n<br />\n<br />This should not affect your FPS heavily.[/center][center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/9951/9951-1540407545-1146720965.png[/img]\n<br />\xfeff[size=3][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/9951/9951-1540408244-1227474343.png[/img][/size][/center][center][font=Georgia][size=1]SpiderAkiraC for permission to port [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50978]AI Overhaul\n<br />[/url]mnikjom for updates\n<br />Qwinn for patches\n<br />[/size][/font][/center]"
