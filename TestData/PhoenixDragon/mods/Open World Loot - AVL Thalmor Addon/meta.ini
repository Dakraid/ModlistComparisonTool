nexusDescription="[center][b][size=6][color=#ffb652]OWL - TWEAKS AND ADDONS[/color][/size][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />When deletepch released [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681]Open World Loot[/url], it was the loot overhaul I had always wanted but never gotten around to making. I was especially happy to see the framework implemented in OWL which makes adding additional items to the levelled lists a breeze and so here we are.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/l1itUFP.png[/img][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][b][size=5][color=#adceff]OWL TWEAKS[/color][/size][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#6f9dba]NO DAEDRIC LOOT[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />I happen to dislike seeing Daedric equipment in random loot so I completely removed it from all levelled lists in the [b]OWL - Randomised Special Loot[/b] plugin. Granted, Daedric loot would only appear from level 65 onward and it would remain exceedingly rare. Now it won't show up in random loot at all. Note that I did not remove Daedric loot from the Dremora merchant who will continue to sell it.\n<br />\n<br />While I'd originally considered to remove Dragonbone equipment as well I ultimately decided to keep it in the levelled lists. It's not unrealistic for other people to dig up dragon bones from the old burial mounds and it will only drop on Solstheim as very rare loot from level 65 onward. Certain enemies in the Soul Cairn will also drop Dragonbone weapons.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#6f9dba]BETTER CIVIL WAR REWARD[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Toward the end of the civil war quest, after the enemy's capital city has been taken, you will be rewarded with a leveled sword regardless of which side you took. Since OWL delevels all unique weapons, it also affects this weapon but for some reason the version you now get is the Glass Sword with the second-best enchantment. I thought this made very little sense especially for people who sided with the Stormcloaks so I changed it to the Ebony Sword with the best enchantment. (I realise that this is a tad pedantic but hey, nobody's forcing you to download this file, eh?)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/l1itUFP.png[/img][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][b][size=5][color=#adceff]OWL AMB ARMOR VARIANTS[/color][/size][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />I used to be a big fan of the original [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24909]aMidianBorn Book of Silence Content Addon[/url] which added a bunch of alternative textures as additional variants to the game. The content addon was [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35390]ported to SSE[/url] by kryptopyr, however, the port is dependent on [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28608]Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered[/url] which suffers from a serious case of feature creep.\n<br />\n<br />When Cabal opened permissions for all aMidianBorn textures, Umgak created [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45160]aMidianBorn Armor Variants Lite[/url] from scratch, an alternative to the Content Addon free of any dependencies. This is what my plugins are based on.\n<br />\n<br />For the following OWL Addons, I split up Umgak's AVL into separate plugins (not everything from AVL is included) and integrated the new variants in OWL's leveled lists. I also changed how the distribution of enchanted variants is handled to avoid unnecessary conflicts between OWL AVL Addons. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#6f9dba]VARIANTS[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Each set can be downloaded separately with patches being included in their FOMOD installers.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]AVL Iron and Steel:[/b] Integrates Iron (Engraved, Polished) and Steel (White Fur) armor variants into the regular leveled lists (requires OWL).\n<br />[*] [b]AVL Thalmor:[/b] Integrates the Thalmor and Thalmor Glass armor variants into the Thalmor leveled lists (does not technically require OWL).\n<br />[*] [b]AVL Morrowind Glass:[/b] Integrates the Morrowind Glass armor variant into the Solstheim leveled lists (requires OWL + Randomised Special Loot).\n<br />[*] [b]AVL Nordic:[/b] Integrates the Nordic (Brown Fur) armor variant into the Solstheim leveled lists (requires OWL).\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Enchanted versions of the Polished Iron, Engraved Iron, White Steel, Morrowind Glass, and Nordic Brown Fur armor variants are integrated in the appropriate leveled lists.\n<br />\n<br />[i]I did not include the Nordic White Fur variant because the metal parts of those textures are a shade darker than the Brown Fur and vanilla versions. As there are no variants for the Nordic Helmet, wearing a set of Nordic White Fur armor with the regular Nordic Helmet would look weird because the helmet would be noticeably brighter.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#6f9dba]COMPATIBILITY[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Patches for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49471]Enchanting Adjustments[/url] (works with either the regular or updated version) are included for each Addon. Thanks to the wonderful [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/57780941]Codygits[/url], patches for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138]Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul[/url] are now also available.\n<br />\n<br />I also added patches for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49771]Modular Armory[/url] to add or change the cubemaps and metalness maps in the texture sets where necessary. Editing meshes was not required as the AVL variants use vanilla meshes but with different texture sets.\n<br />\n<br />For the AVL Thalmor Addon, there's a patch for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41711]aMidianBorn Matching Armory - Glass Armor and Weapons[/url] which assigns the cubemap used in that mod for the vanilla Glass armor also to the Thalmor Glass armor.\n<br />\n<br />While not a hard requirements, I recommend using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994]Weapons Armor Clothing and Clutter Fixes[/url] as the original Open World Loot mod was made with that mod in mind, and I forwarded changes from WACCF and the AMB AVL WACCF Patch. I also recommend adding my [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43466]Tweaks for WACCF and ACE[/url], especially if you're using AVL Iron and Steel so the vanilla naming scheme for Banded Iron Armor variants is used everywhere. I prefer \"Banded Polished Iron Armor\" over \"Iron Reinforced Polished Armor\".\n<br />\n<br />A patch for the footstep feature from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523/]Immersive Sounds - Compendium[/url] 3.x is now included in each FOMOD installer.\n<br />\n<br />Patches for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47115]Simple Smithing Overhaul[/url] available in that mod's file section!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#6f9dba]CHANGELOG[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]AVL IRON AND STEEL ADDON[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]1.4.2\xa0[/b]Updated patch for Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul.\n<br />[b]1.4.1 [/b]Updated patch for Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul.\n<br />[b]1.4[/b] Added a patch for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138]Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul[/url].\n<br />[b]1.3[/b] Added a patch for Immersive Sounds Compendium 3.x (footstep sounds).\n<br />[b]1.2[/b] Adjusted weight for Banded variants (35 &gt; 33) for consistency with WACCF and reverted them to the vanilla naming scheme.\n<br />[b]1.1[/b] Renamed the \"with Pauldron\" armor variants to \"Reinforced\" in accordance with WACCF 2.4.\n<br />[b]1.0[/b] Initial release.\n<br />\n<br />[b]AVL THALMOR ADDON[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]1.1[/b] Added a patch for Immersive Sounds Compendium 3.x (footstep sounds).
