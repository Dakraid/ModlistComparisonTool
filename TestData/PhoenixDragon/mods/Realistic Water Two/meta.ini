While the water is much improved over the original edition of Skyrim, flowing water was applied to nearly all bodies of water, indiscriminately, resulting in odd looking water in certain situations, such as small marsh pools that flow like rivers. Realistic Water Two's (RWT) goal is to correct these issues; thus, providing realistic bodies of water. Lake, marsh, pond, river, and many more waters are provided to create visually distinct bodies of water.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Features\xa0[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Lakes and\xa0ocean water share the same water, visually, which fixes most distant LOD issues[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Lakes, ponds, marsh, and small bodies of water no longer flow in any particular direction[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Ponds, marsh, volcanic, and other waters have unique colors[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Lakes, rivers, and oceans have new, extended ambient sound effects (from 30 to 50 seconds).

Users should allow RWT to overwrite this mesh when using both mods or delete/hide the file from the SMIM installation. RWT fixes a green glow on this mesh caused by certain lighting conditions. The SMIM mesh was used as the base for the included, fixed file so users are still getting the SMIM fixes/updates.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]ENB Particle Patch[/size][/b] - ([url=http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1499]link[/url]) \n<br />Install ENB Particle Patch [b][i] before[/i] [/b] RWT.\n<br />RWT needs to overwrite a lot of effect files in ENB PP.

Without this mod, lowering the timescale will slow down the movement of river water.

If the issue is still there, you've likely found an issue with the mod. Please report the issue using the \"BUGS\" tab above. If you're able to narrow the issue down between RWT and another mod, please report it so that I can look into making a patch.\n<br />\n<br />Else, if you're not sure whether or not it's a RWT issue, you should simply post in the POSTS section. If it's a bug, we can move it to the bug reports later.\n<br />\n<br />Due to the statistic above, users who don't follow these procedures to narrow down the issue before posting a bug report, will simply have their bug reported deleted. These users didn't take the time to follow these procedures and wasted our time by having to do it for them. We don't have time to sort through bug reports that end up being user error.
