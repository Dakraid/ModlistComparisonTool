Many thanks for allowing open permission to port this to SSE. \xa0 The original mod can be found here:\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33994][font=Comic Sans MS][size=4]Underwater Treasure[/size][/font]\n<br />[/url]\xfeff-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]There are 2 versions of the .esp:[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=3]The Sea of Ghosts adds treasure chests to just that area.\xa0 \n<br />The SOG- Rivers and Lakes .esp adds 36 other treasure chests to find in the Lakes and Rivers all over Skyrim.\xa0[/size][/color] \n<br />[size=3]\n<br />There are also 2 new ESL files that clewecks made regarding the SOG-Rivers and Lakes .esp.\xa0 Please look in the comment section to read exactly what clewecks did to these files and his description of the changes he made.\xa0 Many thanks for those files and all credits go to clewecks.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4]This mod is safe to install mid-game.\xa0 It only adds chests to the world.\xa0 A new game is not necessary.\xa0[/size][/color] \n<br />\n<br />Both of the .esp's have been saved in the Creation Kit in form 44.\xa0 No cleaning was necessary as Jokerine cleaned the originals with TES5Edit.\xa0 I ran the azzendix water fix script and it cleaned 35 records.\xa0 No water seams should be in the area at all.\xa0 This mod is very lore-friendly and that's why I felt I should port it over.\xa0 If you really like this,\xa0 I also ported over Hidden Treasures by Ironman5000 and it makes a great companion to this mod as well.\xa0 You can find that one here:\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17460]Hidden Treasures SSE[/url][/size]\n<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]\n<br />Important!!\xa0 Please read the Compatibility notes below regarding other mods.[/size]\n<br />[color=#ffffff]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=3]If you are looking for a fantastic Environmental mod that makes a great partner to this one,\xa0 I would highly recommend Depths of Skyrim - An Underwater Overhaul SSE by TheBlackpixel and it is compatible with this mod.\xa0 Its truly amazing and it changes the underwater scenery for the better and it adds a lot of new things including Shipwrecks and fish.\xa0 You can get it here:[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26913][font=Comic Sans MS][size=5]Depths of Skyrim[/size][/font][/url][/color]\n<br />[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/color][color=#ff7700][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Here is the description by Jokerine on the Oldrim page:[/size][/color]\n<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=5]Features:\n<br />[/size][/font]\n<br />Adds a total of 15 sunken treasure chests and an underwater Dwemer ruin along the coast of the Sea of Ghosts, as well as 36 treasure chests to assorted rivers and lakes around Skyrim for intrepid adventurers to find.\xa0 Cleaned with TESEDIT, script-free and requires no DLC.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][color=#00ffff][size=4]== WHAT ==[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />Hidden riches under the cold waters of Skyrim, obviously! \n<br />\n<br />There aren't very obvious clues to where the chests are, but they are there. An abandoned ship wheel? Some weathered crates half-dug into the sand? Maybe it's just some loose pieces of wood on the beach. Are you feeling lucky? Give it a shot - grab some waterbreathing gear (or just kick off your shoes if you're an Argonian) and take a look around! You may be surprised at what you find.\n<br />\n<br />I wasn't sure of where the limits of the map would be, so the chests in the sea aren't horrendously far from the shore, but I tried to make them at least tricky to spot. They have very generous loot, including enchanted equipment, jewelry, and other items. The average base value is around 800 - 900 septims per chest, so that's quite the treasure! The landlocked chests, on the other hand, have slightly lesser loot, going for around 500-700 septims. All the chests are locked. Since the locks are leveled, if you don't have much skill in lockpicking, be sure to bring plenty of lockpicks with you!\n<br />\n<br />As for the Dwemer ruin, it is very far off from the coast, so you've been warned. There's a map marker for it, so that should help things a bit. Check out [url=http://imgur.com/a/Wq88p#0]this album[/url] for the location of the sunken Dwemer ruin if you absolutely cannot find it.\n<br />\n<br />Also, for some added realism, I wrote several notes for the sea chests that give some insight regarding how they ended up sunk in the bottom of the \n<br />ocean. There is a total of 25, so hopefully they won't repeat too often.I can write more, if needed. The landlocked chests have no notes on them.\n<br />\n<br />Unfortunately, since I wanted to make this challenging even to myself, I purposefully tried not to keep track of where the chests are, so I'm afraid I can't provide a specific list of locations. (The screenshots were taken straight from the Creation Kit). I think it makes the whole thing more exciting. \n<br />\n<br />The chests respawn, so make sure to check them every once in a while. \n<br />[color=#00ffff]\n<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=4]== WHY ==[/size][/font][/color]\n<br />I made this mod for fun, and since there isn't much to do around the northern shores, I would like to share it. \n<br />\n<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][color=#00ffff][size=4]== HOW ==[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your \"Steam/SteamApps/Common/SkyrimSpecialEdition/Data\" folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. \n<br />\n<br />To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you're good to go. Have fun!\n<br />\n<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5]Compatibility:\n<br />[size=3][font=Arial][color=#ffffff][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2182]Realistic Water Two[/url]: Yes.\xa0 \n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26913]Depths of Skyrim[/url]: Yes\n<br />[/color][/font][color=#ffffff]\n<br />Changelog:\n<br />[/color][/size][/size][/color][/font]5-14-2018:\xa0 Version 1.0\xa0\xa0 Initial release for SSE\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />Jokerine:\xa0 For making some really cool mods that I have been able to port over.\n<br />bchick3:\xa0 For making a great guide for me to use to port Oldrim mods to SSE\n<br />Bethesda:\xa0 For making Skyrim SE\n<br />The Nexus Community:\xa0 For a great bunch of people that have made one of the best modding communities in my opinion.\xa0 \n<br />[color=#ff7700]\n<br />[size=3]Jokerine has stated that all of her mods are free to use and can be converted and modified without permission.\xa0 She has also given open and free permission to port her mods to other games including Skyrim SE.\xa0 After a discussion with a moderator,\xa0 we both felt it was a good idea to post a link to Jokerine's profile stating that this is so.\xa0 If you would like to view this yourself,\xa0 her profile can be found here:[/size][/color]\n<br />[url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showuser=2543917]\n<br />Jokerine's Nexus forum profile[/url]\n<br />[size=4][color=#00ffff]\n<br />My other ports from Oldrim:[/color]\n<br />[/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17267]\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17259]Freshly Picked SSE\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17225]Cake O'Clock -
