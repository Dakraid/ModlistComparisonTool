It was initially meant to be part of a larger mod that contained all of the Thieves Guild collectibles, but since that won&#39;t be happening anytime soon I&#39;m putting these up on their own.\r<br />\r<br />The gems have all been given transparent outer and reflective inner layers, similar to my other jewelry mods. They now have a real, detailed gemstone cut that makes them unique while staying true to the original shape. I even faithfully reproduced those rectangular indentations on some of the gems in the normal map of the crown with actual geometry. The crown received a proper cubemap and a few texture adjustments to make the gold look less cheap and yellow. There several textures to choose from for the jewelry box, but you can also use any other replacer you wish in combination with this mod.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you like the result&#33; Feel free to drop by in the comments section if you have any issues or would like to give feedback. And upload pictures to the gallery, I&#39;d love to see how they look in your games.\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]zIURdkTZBNg[/youtube][/center]\r<br />[size=5][b]Installation[/b][/size]\r<br />Install with NMM and follow the instructions.
