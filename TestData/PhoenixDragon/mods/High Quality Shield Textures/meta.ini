Every other quest takes you to a Nordic ruin where these barrow-dwellers guard their treasures, but there was not as close attention paid to them as there could have been. Unique bosses all share the same armor and design, ancient warriors are shambling about with pristine newer iron shields and, latter on, ebony gear, as well as some just straight up baffling stat distribution on the developers' part.\n<br />\n<br />What this mod does, is that it tries to address these shortcomings in order to deliver an improved dungeon diving experience.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4]Features:[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Times New Roman][size=4][b]DRAUGR REVAMPED:[/b][/size][/font]\n<br />- All named bosses now have unique designs taking into account the lore surrounding them.\n<br />- King Borgas has been added into Korvanjund.
