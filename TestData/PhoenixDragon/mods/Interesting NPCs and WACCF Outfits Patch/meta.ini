nexusDescription="Over on /r/skyrimmods recently, someone noticed a curious conflict between iNPC and WACCF that I was too busy modding - instead of playing - to notice. Dagri'Lon, the famously headless mage in the Ratway, was missing his hood - making him even more headless than usual. He and a few other NPCs are affected, because WACCF separates the hoods from vanilla robes. I've simply edited their outfits to provide the new robes and hoods, to maintain the intended aesthetic.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/31858/31858-1579254318-1391869207.png[/img][/url][/center]"
