nexusDescription="[i]The \"flat\" snow drifts in Skyrim are actually 3d meshes hovering some distance above the ground rather than flat decals. In vanilla Skyrim this is fine - you wont even notice it. However, with an ENB those floating snow meshes will have noticeable shadows. This has annoyed me endlessly, to the point that I was simply removing all \"flat\" snow drifts from my game. [/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />After some fiddling in NifSkope it turned out that the dynamic decal flags turn the meshes into decals that attach nicely to whatever they're hovering above. No shadows, no floating snow patches. This doesn't seem to have much downside to it (unless your snow is already hovering over a very complex or vertical mesh), which makes me wonder why no one has done this before... Anyway, I hardly know what I'm doing so please let me know how it works!\n<br />\n<br />A bonus effect of decals is that they actually adapt to the the underlying objects so that you have no snow floating over mesh gaps (see screenshots). This is normally not an issue, since most vanilla meshes are flat surfaces without holes, but with mods you may have snow over gaps otherwise."
