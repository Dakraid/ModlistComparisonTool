nexusDescription="One question I have always asked myself is why are [u][i]wolves so big in Skyrim[/i][/u]? maybe the fantasy\xa0side of things makes sense for the game, but in my opinion, they just looked massive\xa0(as if they were on stilts half the time)\xa0\n<br />\n<br />This is an incredibly small mod which changes the size of wolves to be a bit more realistic while attempting to keep the fantasy side alive\xa0\n<br />\n<br />The size of a normal wolf is (1.0) and an ice wolf (1.15) i.e 15% larger than the normal ones\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Now a normal wolf is (0.75) and an ice wolf (0.79) only 4% bigger, but you can still tell they are bigger just from looking at them\n<br />\n<br />Pit wolves and alpha wolves have also been changed, the largest wolf remains the ice wolf.\n<br />\n<br />Even the summoned sizes have been changed to fit into the changes for the other wolves.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]WV4sq-O_h0A[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />My Patreon https://www.patreon.com/surprisedrook\n<br />\n<br />My Youtube Channel for anyone whos interested...\xa0[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqHe_59_WJYbo58-UTk49mw]SurpirsedRook Youtube Channel\xa0[/url]"
