nexusDescription="Continuing with my series of \"I want to run with unique architecture everywhere, but that requires SO MANY compatibility patches\" series....Kynesgrove! soldierofwar put together an overhaul of Kynesgrove with his [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42639]The Great Village of Kynesgrove[/url]\xfeff, and I've put together a series of compatibility patches for things in my load order which needed it. This one is a bit less thoroughly tested than most of my other patch collections, as I'm a fair way in through a playthrough and I can't add it to my primary list right now. Please let me know if you run into any problems. All patches are ESP flagged as ESL, unless otherwise noted.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Included Patch Descriptions[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194]3DNPC/Interesting NPCs[/url] - Tweaked a number of references both inside the inn and outside to match new layout. WILL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRE A NEW GAME. Literally every single reference in the outdoors is a Persistent reference, and a lot of the triggers wouldn't work with the new layout. Given the Inn has two entrances instead of just one, I made changes to the quest trigger markers to try to cover both doors, but some sequences may be a little off - I recommend using the southern (main) entrance whenever possible if you're in the middle of some 3DNPC quests. Last checked against version 4.4\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654]AI Overhaul SSE[/url] - Conflict resolution on some packages, shifts some markers to match new interior/exterior. Last checked against version 1.6.6\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104]Atlas Map Markers[/url] - NOTE: Based off MCM version. Shifts map marker for inn, and a couple other markers that were embedded in stuff. Last checked against \n<br />version 2.0\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36506]Cheesemod for EVERYONE[/url] - Shifts a few added cheeses to match the new interior/exterior. Last checked against version 1.01\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/276]Cutting Room Floor[/url] - Shifts Froa's spawn point and bed to be inside the new interior of the Braithwood Inn. Shifts tthe goat pen to match the new exterior. Disables the added Lumber Mill so the remaining Lumber Mill matches the new Kynesgrove look, but keeps all other added items (including the non-functional wheel) and the bridge across the river, disabling the dock and the boat up-stream. Redoes navmesh around the lumber mill to match the new look. Applies snow shader to Kynesgrove lumber mill to match the landscape/bridge aesthetics. Last checked against version 3.1.8a\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085]Embers XD[/url] - Shifts the placement of fires to better utilize the new look of Embers XD, includes some ashes spread around. Last checked against version 2.4beta. Will not work with earlier versions.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url] \xfeff- Only one patch this time around, due to there being new buildings and wanting to keep consistency in lighting mood across all of them. Forwards any conflicts having Great Village of Kynesgrove win, shifted door lights, etc, where appropriate. Last checked against version 3.06. A more properly ELFX-ified patch can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46508]over here.\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13552]Expanded Towns and Cities[/url] \xfeff- Applies TGVoKynesgrove aesthetics to the ETaC buildings, redoes the layout, navmesh, etc. Last checked against version 0.6.2\n<br />\n<br />Fishing - Creation Club Patch. Shifts a placed boat so it doesn't clip with Fishing objects.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/595]Immersive Wenches[/url] - moves a couple idle markers to match the new interiors. Also shifts spawn points of a couple exterior ones because they're spawning behind a building that has very little space. Last checked against version 1.60SE\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461]Inigo[/url] - shifts a placed note to match the new inn interior. Last checked against version 2.4C\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138]Landscape and Water Fixes[/url] - Forwards a few ownership changes from the latest update of landscape and water fixes. Last checked against version 5.7\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817]Lanterns of Skyrim II [/url]\xfeff- CR patch to make sure the moved lanterns are the new type. Shifts the light from the smelter to the smelter's new location. Last checked against version 4.0\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802]Legacy of the Dragonborn [/url]\xfeff- Moves a drunk idle marker to match new inn interior. Last checked against version 5.4.4\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2650]RS Children Overhaul[/url] - Makes the added children work with RS Children Overhaul. God help me, I've successfully done facegen now. Also changes the outfit of one of the kids because the clothes didn't have a body. Last checked against version 1.3.3. Includes all changes from the USSEP patch.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12371]Skyrim 3D Trees and Plants[/url] - Applies the 3D Trees wheat to the references added by TGVoKynesgrove. Last checked against version 5.0.1\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5261]Skyrims Unique Treasures[/url] - Shifts one placed object to match new interior, and a buried chest to match new exterior. Last checked against version 4.4\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2414]Snazzy Furniture and Clutter Overhaul[/url] - Shifts placed paintings to match new interior. Last checked against version 2.0\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch[/url] - Forwards cell changes, ownership changes, and an NPC record change. Last checked against version 4.2.3.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2296]Verdant [/url]- DOES NOT REQUIRE VERDANT AS MASTER. Verdant adds grass to a couple texture types which makes a few paths seem more overgrown than they \n<br />should have. This patch re-paints those stretches to be types which don't have grass, for Verdant. It may assist with other grass mods that do the same, as well, so master is not set.\n<br />\n<br />Other patches I'm aware of: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46510]Distinct Interiors[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42423?]Immersive Laundry[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Installation[/i][/size]\n<br />Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into you Skyrim data folder. Patches should have their appropriate masters set, and should be loaded after any mods which they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects, and may require a new save.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Compatibility[/i][/size]\n<br />I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods. All moved objects should have been moved to locations which are non-overlapping. Let me know if you hit anything\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Credits[/i][/size]\n<br />[url=https://bethesda.net/]Bethesda[/url] for Skyrim Special Edition and the Creation Kit\n<br />ElminsterAU for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164]SSEEdit[/url]\n<br />soldierofwar for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42639]The Great Village of Kynesgrove[/url]\n<br />Kris Takahashi for [url=https://3dnpc.com]Interesting NPCs[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194]KaptainCnucklz[/url] for keeping track of it on Nexus\n<br />\xfeff\xfeffmnikjom and SpiderAkiraC for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654]AI Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />Kronixx and kryptopyr for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104]Atlas Map Markers[/url]\n<br />aviform, EpicCrab, DoubtSuspended, PhysicsFish, and Daniel Hodge for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36506]Cheesemod for EVERYONE[/url]\n<br />Arthmoor for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/276]Cutting Room Floor[/url]\xfeff\n<br />mindflux for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085]Embers XD[/url]\n<br />anamorfus for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url]\n<br />missjennabee for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13552]Expanded Towns and Cities[/url]\n<br />lordkoz for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/595]Immersive Wenches[/url]\n<br />smartbluecat for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461]Inigo[/url]\n<br />wizkid34 and lilebonymace for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138]Landscape and Water Fixes[/url]\n<br />wizkid34 for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817]Lanterns of Skyrim II[/url] and Tamriel Master Lights\n<br />icecreamassassin, SirJesto, and the LOTD team for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802]Legacy of the Dragonborn[/url]\n<br />Ranaline and Atsuraelu for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2650]RS Children Overhaul[/url]\n<br />mathy79 for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12371]Skyrim 3D Trees and Plants[/url]\xfeff\n<br />clintmich for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5261]Skyrims Unique Treasures[/url]\n<br />gutmaw for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2414]Snazzy Furniture and Clutter Overhaul[/url]\n<br />Arthmoor and the Unofficial Patch Team for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Project\n<br />[/url]Preeum for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2296]Verdant[/url]\xfeff and for advice on making patches on his page"
