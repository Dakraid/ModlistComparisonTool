nexusDescription="[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/hTP2KHh.jpg[/img][/center]Inspired by the wonderful [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34539/?]Battle Hardened Warpaints[/url], I set out to retexture the vanilla warpaint designs in a similar fashion. And so Painterly was born.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0 retextures the 10 default designs available to guys and girls of all non-beast races, as well as all specific (non-beast) racial designs**. This is a 2k, high resolution retexture (2048x2048). I have also included several alternate textures for the default hand print design, on a varying scale of smeariness. Just rename whichever texture you prefer to &#34;[fe]maleheadwarpaint_08.dds&#34;. \r<br />\r<br />**small caveat: RaceMenu&#39;s Makeup Texture selection shows several textures that I haven&#39;t currently retextured, namely Black Blood tattoos, Forsworn\r<br /> tattoos, and beast stripes/markings. See Future Plans for more details.\r<br />\r<br />The main file replaces the default textures, so the main &#34;Warpaint&#34; slider will show the retextured designs. This also means that you will be able to select and layer designs in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?]RaceMenu[/url] by default, with no need for an extra esp. (See images for RaceMenu location/details.) Please leave a comment if you&#39;re interested in a non-replacing, RaceMenu .esp version&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][b]IMPORTANT:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This mod relies on SKSE&#39;s fix for high-quality tint masks, in order to display them at their full resolution. To enable this, add the following lines to your SKSE.ini file (Data&#92;SKSE&#92;SKSE.ini):\r<br />\r<br />[Display]\r<br />iTintTextureResolution=2048\r<br />[center][color=#00ffff][b]\r<br />Installation & Uninstallation[/b][/color][/center]\r<br />If you&#39;re using MO or NMM, install and uninstall like any other mod&#33; :)\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re not using a mod manager, simply extract the contents to your Skyrim folder (Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim).\r<br />\r<br />To uninstall manually, remove the following files:\r<br />Data&#92;textures&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;character assets&#92;tintmasks&#92;*Any filename containing &#34;female&#34; and &#34;warpaint&#34;*.dds\r<br />Data&#92;textures&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;character assets&#92;tintmasks&#92;*Any filename containing &#34;male&#34; and &#34;warpaint&#34;*.dds\r<br />[b][center][color=#00ffff]\r<br />Future plans[/color][/center][/b]\r<br />There are several unique racial designs that are only male or only female; however, selecting them through RaceMenu is an imperfect solution because the texture positioning is slightly misaligned. In the future, I plan to convert the unique designs to the opposite gender and release them as a RaceMenu plugin.\r<br />\r<br />Forsworn tattoos are not included in version 1, because they are almost too intricate for the painterly style. However, I might make them a potential update if I&#39;m so inclined/you all want them.\r<br />\r<br />I will not be retexturing the beast race stripes/markings at all, or the Black Blood tattoos.\r<br />[center][color=#fff2cc]\r<br />[size=3][b]~~UPTOWN FUNK YOU UP~~[/b][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />Please note that there is a potential for funkiness that is [color=#f4cccc]outside of my control[/color]. All my texture shapes are based on [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29977/]XCE&#39;s High Res retexture[/url], which in turn is based on the very low res vanilla warpaint. With the variety of different morph shapes, the way textures map onto the face don&#39;t always look their best. In the example above, &#34;vanilla&#34;/XCE&#39;s retex is on the right and mine is on the left - both of them look pretty wonky simply because of the way the morphs are affecting the warpaint.\r<br />[center]\r<br />[url=http://i.imgur.com/FhUMHUs.jpg][img]http://i.imgur.com/FhUMHUs.jpg[/img][/url][/center]"
