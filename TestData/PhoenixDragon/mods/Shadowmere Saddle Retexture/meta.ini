nexusDescription="A retexture of Shadowmere's saddle in 4K or optional 2K, has alternate color option and also a dirt overlay option. Has included esp as i've made the saddle unique otherwise it would use the mask and normal map from the imperial saddle which has the skyrim emblem on the bridle. If you are not bothered about the outline of the skyrim emblem showing up on the bridle you can just install one of the JUST DIFFUSE options in MISCELLANEOUS section, there is also a dirt overlay option there for use with them. This will save space and an esp slot with a VERY minor graphical issue.\n<br />\n<br />Added a Nordic saddle alternative in version 1.1. Has 2K option and the dirt overlay option."
