Unfortunately by doing this, you won\x2019t get the drunk AI package, unless the original face mod creator makes a patch for their replacer to include the AI updated package. This can be done in SSEEdit, by loading my mod, and the replacer, and dragging the drunk AI package into the character.\n<br />\n<br />For any bug reporting, please join the Discord server above and report it there, you will get a quicker response :-) The comments section here has been closed due to me not having the time to reply to everyone, but thank you for all your nice comments :-)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][size=5][b][u]Xbox One Version:[/u][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />All Xbox users can now download the newest update of my mod converted by the wonderful Laura_Moon\n<br />She has also converted Kaidan 2.1.1 for you all as well!\n<br />IMPORTANT: You must install the new version of Kaidan converted by Laura_Moon, otherwise my mod will not work with the old version. The version is the same as can be found for PC gamers, so that is good a reason to upgrade in itself!\xa0\n<br />Xbox Kaidan 2.1.1:\xa0[url=https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4264298]https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4264298\n<br />[/url]Xbox Kaidan Extended Edition Add-on: [url=https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4264172]https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4264172[/url]\n<br />Thank you Laura_Moon for your hard work in getting the mods available for Xbox players :-)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5][b][u]CREDITS:\xa0[/u][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />A huge thank you to LivTempleton for Kaidan\n<br />Dan Lemon for his perfect voice work and super charming personality!\n<br /> The Kaidan Wolf Pack x\n<br />Ayalet, for being the best friend I could ever have, the one who keeps in touch with Dan (Ayalet was the one who donated the first new lines for Kaidan to my mod) and also she is an amazing person to write scripts with. Also, thanks to Ayalet for the lovely Kaidan screenshots!\n<br />HanShotFirst01 for making Kaidan so immersive and being an amazing person x\n<br />Axarien for her awesome writing skills and being so great x Also Axarien's \"cold series\" dialogue, love it!\n<br />Dovahnique, Pixie, Rose and MoonflowerTea for dialogue x\n<br />Everyone over at the ExtendedEdition server, because you're all amazing people who I love dearly x (I wish I could put all your names up here, but you know who you are x)\n<br />SmartBlueCat for Inigo and allowing us to make an interaction patch.\n<br />Thank you RegTonia for the instructions on how to make the drunk AI package.\xa0\n<br />Thank you to KatieCubed for some of the cleaned up audio files.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />I am also wanting to make this mod have integration with Fertility Adventures in the future (I have the dialogue for this already, just need the knowledge!)\n<br />\n<br />Kaidan now has an AI rest package for drinking in inns, he will drink wine, drink plenty of ale and get excited about it lol! Plus he will get the drunk walk animation. If you have a Kaidan replacer, it would need to be updated and linked on to my mod to incorporate this new AI package otherwise it won't work. There isn't anything I can do about this myself, so you would need to do this in Creation Kit if you want that option. Kaidan replacer mod authors can of course release a patch for their custom replacers, so that they can include the new AI package.\n<br />There appears to be a bug when you ask Kaidan to follow you when he''s doing his drunk walk: he will continue to do this! So make sure he's not drunk walking before you ask him to leave with you. If you do find that he is drunk walking when you ask him to follow you again, just fast travel somewhere and this will update his AI.\n<br />Also, sometimes Kaidan will sit down when resting at an inn, then stand on the chair drinking wine, I can\x2019t find a solution for this at the moment.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Please read the changelogs section for more info on what this new update has.\n<br />\n<br />This is my addon for LivTempleton's Kaidan 2. Many people have requested me to reupload it, after I had taken it down due to personal reasons which I will keep out of my description. I am keeping my word for the people who donated to the mod, and also to all the people who reached out to me.\xa0\n<br />I know that many of you like this and I am NOT letting you down by keeping it offline, that would be unfair.\n<br />\n<br />Kaidan 2 now has over a thousand new dialogue lines and fixed fuzzy voice. Also he now has quest comments, more idle comments, weather comments and more. Thank you to all you lovely people who gave us your ideas and excellent line requests, I listed to you and I am delivering!\xa0\n<br />Thank you to everyone who has sent me your beautiful messages, I appreciate all the love, support and encouragement you have all given, and continue to give me.\xa0Just wanted to say a personal thank you to all of you who have messaged me. I'm sorry if I haven't got back to you yet, there are so many messages to get through, but I am grateful for every single one of them. Also, a huge thanks for the endorsements, I really appreciate that you have endorsed my mod.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][color=#00ff00][size=5]RECOMMENDED MODS:[/size][/color][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />High Poly Kaidan - Face and Body, by Katarsi: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59975]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59975\n<br />[/url]\xfeffKaidan 2 HD Armor Retexture, by Foamimi:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59736]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59736[/url]\n<br />Dovahnique's Kaidan Replacer by Dovahnique:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68292]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68292[/url]\xfeff\n<br />Axarien's Kaidan Full Body Replacer by Axarien:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69251]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69251[/url]\xfeff\n<br />Axarien's Kaidan Silvered High Poly Head and Body Replacer by Axarien:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71273]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71273[/url]\xfeff\n<br />Axarien's Kaidan Animation Pack, by Axarien: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69678]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69678[/url]\xfeff\n<br />Kaidan 2 Replacer by Ljty76810a\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69226]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69226[/url]\xfeff\n<br />Majestic Kaidan Replacer by Urbon:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67011]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67011[/url]\xfeff\n<br />Kaidan 2 Visual Overhaul Patch for PoeticAnt's Kaidan by Meriweather1812:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69190]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69190[/url]\xfeff\n<br />Kaidan 2 Katana Replacer:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44905]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44905\n<br />[/url]Kaidan 2 OStim Patch by Moosmupfel : [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65979]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65979[/url]\n<br />Van's SE Kaidan Replacer by VanNuys22:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52998]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52998\n<br />[/url]Rosalind Replacer by VanNuys22:[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66420]\xa0https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66420[/url]\xfeff\n<br />KaiNeedy by HanShotFirst01:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69259]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69259[/url]\xfeff\n<br />Kaidan - Immersive Lap Sitting by HanShotFirst01:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68662]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68662[/url]\xfeff\n<br />Kaidan 2 A Skyrim Kiss Integration by HanShotFirst01:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68090]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68090\n<br />[/url]Animated Wedding Scene &amp; Kaidan Patch by CinnaMewRoll: \xfeff[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37976]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37976\n<br />[/url]Legacy of the Dragonborn Artifact\xa0Immersion Kaidan Patch by Kriana: \xfeff[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68078/]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68078/[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[u][b][color=#00ff00][size=5]\n<br />[/size][/color][/b][/u][size=4][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37976]\n<br />[/url]If you like my work, feel free to buy me a Ko-fi :-) Thank you![/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://ko-fi.com/kaidanayalet][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/63348/63348-1652649526-592471063.png[/img][/url]\xfeff\xfeff\n<br />[u][b][color=#00ff00][size=5]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />USEAGE TERMS:[/size][/color][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />[u]I DO NOT give permission for anyone to edit this mod in any way, shape or form[/u].
