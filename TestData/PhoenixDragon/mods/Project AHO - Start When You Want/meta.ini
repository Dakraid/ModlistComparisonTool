nexusDescription="Updated for version 2, with lots of bumbling around by me and some nifty scripting and stuff from\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5646623]AndrealphusVIII[/url]\xa0(check his other mods).\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Normal ESP or ESL Flagged versions are available.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Skyrim LE Version is over -----&gt;\xa0https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/94791\n<br />\n<br />Version 2.0 prevents the orc spawning by default.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />When you are ready to start Project AHO, and are level 15 or higher, as required by original quest, head to the Braidwood Inn (located at Kynesgrove).\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Talk to Iddra the innkeeper, she will have a note for you to investigate a suspicious orc at Mixwater Mill.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />On reading the note, Shaglak should find you next time you visit the mill.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Old Version 1 Instructions below, if for some reason your still using Project AHO V1.0.\n<br />\n<br />The mod adds a quest note in Riverwood on the bar at the sleeping giant with a vaguely plausible reason why the quest wont be triggered until you pick it up. If you want to use the mod in your play-through, click the start mod option as you would normally, it just wont start until you have the note.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />The only downside is Shaglak will probably find you as soon as you leave the inn. Alas i dont know how to stop the quest triggering until you left the Riverwood area. Alternately you can use additem menu to search for Shaglak's Note and next time you port somewhere outside a city/house etc he should appear. (No refund paid if he doesn't).\xa0\n<br />\n<br />(Alternate version with the note located over the Riverwood bridge on the signpost, Shaglak probably wont appear until you have fast travelled around the wilderness or changed cells a few times)."
