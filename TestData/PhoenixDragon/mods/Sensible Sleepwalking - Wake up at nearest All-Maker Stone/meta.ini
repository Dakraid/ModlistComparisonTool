nexusDescription="This mod reworks the Solstheim sleepwalking mechanic so that you will only ever wake up at the nearest All-Maker Stone from where you sleep, just like how NPCs only go to the nearest Stone from where they live. This makes it possible to sleep on Solstheim without a risk of randomly being flung to any other part of the island. It also means that if you cleanse a Stone, you can sleep near it without being affected by the hypnosis.\n<br />\n<br />For whatever reason, it seems the developers excluded the Water Stone from the possible selection. I have not changed this.\n<br />\n<br />There used to be another mod that did this, but it was deleted, so I've made this as a replacement."
