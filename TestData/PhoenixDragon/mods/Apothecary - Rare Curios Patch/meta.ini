nexusDescription="[b][size=5][color=#9fc5e8][center]Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul\xa0[/center][/color][/size][/b]\n<br />Apothecary is a complete overhaul of Skyrim\x2019s alchemy, food, and alcohol systems designed to balance existing potions, poisons, foods, and alcohols while adding powerful new effects to the game. The mod normalizes the magnitude of all alchemical ingredients in order to eliminate the gameplay loop of checking UESP to see which effects have slightly higher potencies, or chasing Salmon Roe to level up. It also significantly reduces the gold value of both player-created potions and generic potions while ensuring that the player still levels at a faster rate than Vanilla. In addition, the mod rebalances generic potions so that their strongest and weakest variants match the potency of player-created potions. Finally, Apothecary removes several useless or poorly implemented effects in order to make room for more interesting new effects without adding new ingredients.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Apothecary does not require my other mods, but it is designed to be consistent with them. For instance, Apothecary adds poisons for each of the new Illusion archetypes and several of the new Alteration archetypes added by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839?tab=description&amp;BH=2]Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul[/url].\n<br />\n<br />The Apothecary Food and Drink Addon is offered as a separate ESP with no dependencies on the main file of Apothecary to allow users the freedom to mix and match Apothecary with other mods.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][size=4][b]Potions\xa0[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The magnitudes in the following list reflect the strength of a potion created by a character with 100 Alchemy and all of the Vanilla perks. Generic potions have been reworked to be consistent with player-created potions at all levels.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][b][Spoiler]Restore Health -[/b] Restores 30 Health per second for 10 seconds.\n<br />[b]Restore Magicka -[/b] Restores 30 Magicka per second for 10 seconds.\n<br />[b]Restore Stamina -[/b] Restores 30 Stamina per second for 10 seconds.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Fortify Health -[/b] Your Health is increased by 100 for 300 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Magicka -[/b] Your Magicka is increased by 100 for 300 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Stamina -[/b] Your Stamina is increased by 100 for 300 seconds.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Fortify Health Regeneration -[/b] Your Health Regeneration is increased by 100% for 300 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Magicka Regeneration -[/b] Your Magicka Regeneration is increased by 100% for 300 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Stamina Regeneration -[/b] Your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 100% for 300 seconds.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Fortify One-handed -[/b] You deal 50% extra damage with One-handed weapons for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Two-handed - [/b]You deal 50% extra damage with Two-handed weapons for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Archery -[/b] You deal 50% extra damage with bows for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Block - [/b]You are 50% more effective at blocking and bashing.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Fortify Alteration Power - [/b]Your Alteration spells last 100% longer for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Conjuration Power -[/b] Your Conjuration spells last 100% longer for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Destruction Power - [/b]Your Destruction spells are 50% stronger for 60 seconds.\xa0\n<br />[b]Fortify Illusion Power -[/b] Your Illusion spells are 50% stronger for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Restoration Power - [/b]Your Restoration spells are 50% stronger for 60 seconds.\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />Fortify Sneak Attacks - [/b]You deal 50% extra damage with sneak attacks and spells for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Power Attacks [/b]- You deal 50% extra damage with power attacks for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Shouts -[/b] You deal 100% extra damage with Shouts for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Unarmed -[/b] You deal 50% extra unarmed damage for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Reflect Damage - [/b]You reflect 100% of incoming melee damage back at your attacker for 60 seconds.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Fortify Lockpicking -[/b] You are 50% better at lockpicking for 60 seconds.\xa0\n<br />[b]Fortify Pickpocket - [/b]You are 50% better at pickpocketing for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Fortify Sneak -[/b] You are 50% harder to detect while sneaking for 60 seconds.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Resist Fire - [/b]Your Fire Resistance is increased by 50% for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Resist Frost - [/b]Your Frost Resistance is increased by 50% for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Resist Shock - [/b]Your Shock Resistance is increased by 50% for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Resist Poison -[/b] Your Poison Resistance is increased by 50% for 60 seconds.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Resist Magic -[/b] Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25% for 300 seconds.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Fortify Armor Rating - [/b]Your Armor Rating is increased by 100 for 300 seconds\xa0\n<br />[b]Fortify Carry Weight -[/b] Your Carry Weight is increased by 100 for 300 seconds\n<br />[b]Fortify Barter -[/b] Your receive 25% better prices for 300 seconds\n<br />\n<br />[b]Fortify Speed [/b]- You move 20% faster for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Waterbreathing -[/b] You can breathe underwater for 60 seconds\xa0\n<br />[b]Waterwalking - [/b]You can walk on water for 60 seconds\xa0\n<br />[b]\n<br />Muffle -[/b]\xa0You move silently for 60 seconds.\n<br />[b]Invisibility - [/b]You become invisible for 60 seconds.\xa0\n<br />[b]Become Ethereal -[/b] You become ethereal for 60 seconds\n<br />\n<br />[b]Cure Disease -[/b] it just cures diseases lol idk what to write here[/spoiler]\n<br />[/color][b][color=#93c47d][size=3]Notes\xa0[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*]Restore Health, Magicka, or Stamina Potions work over 10 seconds.

This means that poisons such as Burden and Weakness to Fire are weaker against targets with high Poison Resistance, and stronger against targets with low Poison Resistance. It also means that Poisons of Weakness to Poison can be stacked infinitely, leading to ridiculous effects. Because of this, in earlier versions of Apothecary, debuff poisons were quite weak, because we had to assume the player was using Weakness to Poison effects to buff their strength considerably.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />However, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43532]Scrambled Bugs[/url] now comes with a \"Poison Resistance\" patch that allows us to create poisons that aren't resisted by Poison Resistance. This allows us to balance debuff poisons such as Damage Armor and Weakness to Frost in much the same way that we balance similar spells in Mysticism. It also allows the Weakness to Poison effect to exist without stacking with itself infinitely. \n<br />\n<br />We [i]strongly [/i]recommend that you download Scrambled Bugs and turn the \"Poison Resistance\" patch on. With the patch activated, poisons of Burden, Damage Weapon, Damage Armor, Weakness to Fire, Weakness to Frost, and Weakness to Shock will be fully resisted by an enemy with 100% Poison Resistance, since they are considered \"immune\" to Poisons. However, once you reduce an enemy's Poison Resistance to any value below 100%, debuff poisons will produce their full effect (this is similar to how Mysticism balances debuff spells). In addition, poisons of Weakness to Poison will work on targets [i]even with 100% Poison Resistance[/i], allowing alchemists to affect highly resistant enemies without resorting to other skills such as Enchanting or Alteration. This also solves the problem where poisons of Weakness to Poison are ineffective on the very enemies you'd most like to use them on.\n<br />\n<br />With the Poison Resistance patch activated, Poisons of Damage Health, Damage Magicka, Damage Stamina, Lingering Damage Health, Lingering Damage Magicka, Lingering Damage Stamina, Calm, Frenzy, Silence, Fear, Paralysis, and Command continue to scale on Poison Resistance, meaning these poisons will be less effective against an enemy with high Poison Resistance and more effective against an enemy with low Poison Resistance.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=5][b]Apothecary Food and Drink Addon[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />In addition to\xa0overhauling alchemy, Apothecary also offers an optional plugin that tweaks food, alcohol, and drugs. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4][b]Food\xa0[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />In Apothecary, food items provide long-lasting buffs to Health Regeneration, Magicka Regeneration, and Stamina Regeneration. The type of buff a food item provides, and the magnitude of that buff, are based on the items used to create the food. Meats, stews, and breads provide Health Regeneration; desserts and cheeses provide Magicka Regeneration; vegetables, and soups provide Stamina Regeneration. Since players can have one source of each buff active at a time, Apothecary encourages the consumption of a wide variety of food items.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />By default, all food items last for 30 minutes. If you are using a survival mod and would like to reduce the duration of food items, I have provided an optional patch which reduces the duration of these items to 10 minutes. You can also use the patch as a model for creating your own custom duration for food items.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=3][b]10% Foods[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />These foods are raw or uncooked items. They are not intended to be eaten in their current state.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b][spoiler]Health Regeneration:[/b]\xa0\x42read, Raw Beef, Chicken Breast, Clam Meat, Dog Meat, Goat Leg, Horker Meat, Horse Meat, Mammoth Snout, Pheasant Meat, Rabbit Leg, Salmon Meat, Venison, Mudcrab Legs, Ash Hopper Leg, Ash Hopper Meat, Boar Meat.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Magicka Regeneration: [/b]Goat Cheese Wedge, Eidar Cheese Wedge, Honey, Butter, Jug of Milk\n<br />\n<br />[b]Stamina Regeneration:[/b] Red Apple, Green Apple, Cabbage, Carrot, Gourd, Leek, Potato, Tomato, Sack of Flour, Ash Yam.[/spoiler]\n<br />[size=3][b]25% Foods[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />These foods represent the basic components of a full meal. Most of these recipes simply require combining salt with one additional ingredient.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b][spoiler]Health Regeneration: [/b]Bread Loaf, Garlic Bread, Cooked Beef, Grilled Chicken Breast, Venison Chop, Roasted Goat Leg, Horker Loaf, Horse Haunch, Mammoth Steak, Pheasant Roast, Rabbit Haunch, Salmon Steak, Seared Slaughterfish, Charred Skeever Hide, Steamed Mudcrab Legs.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Magicka Regeneration:[/b] Boiled Creme Treat, Goat Cheese Wheel, Sliced Goat Cheese Wheel, Eidar Cheese Wheel, Sliced Eidar Cheese Wheel, Honey Nut Treat, Long Taffy Treat, Mammoth Cheese, Sweet Roll \n<br />\n<br />[b]Stamina Regeneration: [/b]Cabbage Soup, Tomato Soup, Potato Soup, Grilled Leeks, Baked Potato.[/spoiler]\n<br />[b][size=3]50% Foods[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />These foods represent the highest quality meals you can create. Most of them require additional ingredients such as Garlic or Lavender. Some of them require the specialized crafting stations found in Hearthfire kitchens.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][b][spoiler]Health Regeneration:[/b]\xa0\x42raided Bread, Potato Bread, Beef Stew, Horker Stew, Venison Stew, Boar Stew, Mammoth Stew, Goat Stew, Ash Hopper Stew, Horker and Ash Yam Stew, Beef Dumpling, Chicken Dumpling, Horker Dumpling, Mammoth Dumpling, Venison Dumpling, Clam Chowder.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Magicka Regeneration:[/b] Goat Cheese Fondue, Mammoth Cheese Fondue, Elsweyr Fondue, Apple Pie, Apple Dumpling, Snowberry Dumpling, Honey Dumpling, Jazbay Dumpling, Juniper Berry Dumpling, Jazbay Crostata, Juniper Berry Crostata, Snowberry Crostata\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]Stamina Regeneration: [/b]Apple Cabbage Soup, Cabbage Potato Soup, Tomato and Leek Soup, Vegetable Soup.[/spoiler]\n<br />[b][size=4]Homecooked Meal[/size][/b][/color][b][size=4]\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />The homecooked meal represents a \x201csuper food\x201d that grants you 50% Health, Magicka, and Stamina Regeneration, essentially rolling three of the best food items into one. You can only acquire a homecooked meal through marriage, and you are limited to one such meal per day.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966][size=4]Alcohol[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />In Vanilla, alcoholic drinks are largely forgettable, since they often restore small amounts of Stamina, while subsequently reducing the player\x2019s Stamina Regeneration. In Apothecary, ales, meads, whiskeys, and rums buff the player\x2019s Stamina and reduce their Magicka, while wines and brandies buff the player\x2019s Magicka and reduce their Stamina. All alcoholic drinks last for ten minutes.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][b][spoiler]+25 Stamina, -25 Magicka: [/b]Ale, Mead, Black-Briar Mead, Honningbrew Mead, Spiced Rum, Cyrodilic Whiskey, Ashfire Mead, Mazte, Sujamma\n<br />\n<br />[b]+50 Stamina, -50 Magicka:[/b] Black-Briar Reserve, Red Eagle\x2019s Rye, Wrothgarian Rum, White-Gold Tower, Cliff Racer, Sadri\x2019s Sujamma\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]+25 Magicka, -25 Stamina:[/b] Wine, Alto Wine, Spiced Wine, Jessica\x2019s Wine, Emberbrand Wine, Shein, Flin, Cyrodilic Brandy\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]+50 Magicka, -50 Stamina:[/b] Argonian Bloodwine, Firebrand Wine, Surilie Brothers Wine, Colovian Brandy, Velvet LeChance[/spoiler][/color]\n<br />[color=#e06666][size=4][b]Drugs[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Apothecary also edits Skooma and Sleeping Tree Sap. Skooma has a buff that is similar to that of ales and meads, while Sleeping Tree Sap has a buff that is similar to that of wines and brandies. Redwater Skooma also has a unique effect. Most drug items last for five minutes. The buffs from Skooma and Sleeping Tree Sap do not stack with the buffs from alcohol.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e06666][b][spoiler]Sleeping Tree Sap - [/b]For 300 seconds, your Magicka is increased by 100, but your Stamina is decreased by 100.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Skooma - [/b]For 300 seconds, your Stamina is increased by 100, but your Magicka is decreased by 100.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Redwater Skooma - [/b]For 300 seconds, your Health is increased by 100, but your Magicka and Stamina are decreased by 50.[/spoiler][/color]\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=4][b]General Changes and Removed Effects[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Apothecary removes several potion effects from the game. Sometimes, these potion effects were removed for balance reasons (Fortify Smithing and Fortify Enchanting); sometimes, they were only removed because they were redundant with a new or existing effect (Damage Magicka Regeneration, Fortify Light Armor). Removing these effects allowed us to add our new effects with minimizing changes to existing recipes, so most of the combinations you remember will still work fine. However, in a few places, we did make changes to existing effects, and we do welcome feedback as to whether some effects feel rarer than they should be. We also changed the rarity of a few ingredients. Now that we\x2019ve normalized the magnitude of all potion archetypes, it simply doesn\x2019t make sense for items like Salmon Roe to be as rare as they are. Finally, we tweaked Sinderion's Serendipity (it's called Sinderion's Legacy now) to be a little more desirable and to work better with perk overhauls.\n<br />\n<br />A list of removed effects can be found below. \n<br />\n<br />[Spoiler]Fortify Smithing\n<br />Fortify Enchanting\n<br />Fortify Heavy Armor\n<br />Fortify Light Armor\n<br />Cure Poison\n<br />Ravage Health\n<br />Ravage Magicka\n<br />Ravage Stamina\n<br />Damage Magicka Regeneration\n<br />Damage Stamina Regeneration[/spoiler]\n<br />The Apothecary Food and Drink Addon adds several new foods and changes the recipes for existing food items. It also adds new alcohols and adds them to the appropriate leveled lists.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=5]Compatibility[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Apothecary is not compatible with other alchemy overhauls. You will need a patch for any mod that adds new ingredients, in order to adjust their magnitudes, durations, and gold values to be in line with Apothecary. Apothecary may also have some minor compatibility issues with mods that add new player-crafted enchantments. This is because both alchemy and enchanting mods need to make use of the same \x201cUnused Actor Values\x201d to implement their effects. The incompatibility should be limited to specific enchantments that use the same actor values as Apothecary.\n<br />\n<br />The Apothecary Food and Drink Addon is not compatible with other mods that change food and alcohol. It should be compatible with Sunhelm out of the box.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=5][b]Simon's Mods[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686]Aetherius - A Race Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411]Mundus - A Standing Stone Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839]Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191]Adamant - A Perk Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487]Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549]Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639]Scion - A Vampire Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746]Manbeast - A Werewolf Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130]Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099]Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul\xa0\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138]Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790][size=2]Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon[/size][/url][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][b][size=5]DeltaRider's Mods[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36276]Forceful Tongue - Shouts Overhaul[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41950]Dragonborn - Shouts Perk Tree[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44969]True Teacher Durnehviir[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52007]Sil Gahrot - Improved Shout Learning[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310?tab=files]Dragon War - A Dragon Overhaul[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67272]Arachnomancy - A Spider Scrolls Overhaul[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69513]Oblivion - An Atronach Forge Overhaul[/url][/size]"
