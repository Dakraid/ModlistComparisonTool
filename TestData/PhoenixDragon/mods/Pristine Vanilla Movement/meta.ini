nexusDescription="[center][color=#d9d2e9][size=5]Pristine Vanilla Movement[/size][/color]\n<br />Base Animation Replacer by Everglaid\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/44449/44449-1646947711-672090167.png[/img]\n<br />[youtube]TWPI4X5d80o[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />I've always stuck to vanilla movement, even with the many options out there. I just like how it looks.\n<br />After delving into making some run/walk anims for another project (hehe) I noticed little things in vanilla that I can't unsee.\n<br />\n<br />This mod edits the vanilla run &amp; walk animations, fixing broken loops, jittery limbs, 'clicking' motions, etc.\n<br />It also stylizes a bit, smoothing out arcs and changing posture. Animations are more casual looking. Run has a slight bounce.\n<br />\n<br />Covers all 8 directions, walk, run, sprint, male &amp; female.\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/44449/44449-1646947711-672090167.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\n<br />Please use a mod manager.\n<br />Safe to uninstall mid-game.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements:[/b]\n<br />None.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Recommended Mods:[/b]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614]True Directional Movement[/url]\xfeff - 360\xb0 movement &amp; procedural leaning\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252]SmoothCam[/url]\xfeff - prevents any camera location/fov snapping\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility:[/b]\n<br />This is just an animation replacer like other mods.\n<br />Feel free to use this as a 'base' mod and have other animation sets overwrite this one, based on your preference.\n<br />Many animation sets do not cover the 6 backward animations.
