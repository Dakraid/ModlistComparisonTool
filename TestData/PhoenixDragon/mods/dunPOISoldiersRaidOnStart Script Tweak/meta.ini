nexusDescription="The [i]dunPOIReachForswornRaidQST[/i] quest is about two soldiers attacking a small Forsworn camp.\n<br />[url=https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Forsworn_Camp:_Reachwater_River]https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Forsworn_Camp:_Reachwater_River[/url]\n<br />\n<br />The quest/event is supposed to start when you get near the camp and should stop when you go away.\n<br />Usually it starts when you walk along the road minding your own business and don't even notice the not-so-visible place -- and of course you have no idea that something has started behind your back.\n<br />\n<br />Sometimes (often, in my game) the script [i]dunPOISoldiersRaidOnStart[/i] doesn't stop looping and stays active in the save game -- and even manages to\xa0 multiply itself, lol.\n<br />Consequently, the related [i]dunPOIReachForswornRaidQST[/i] quest doesn't stop when it should.\n<br />While the original script looks fine and should work as intended, for some reason it not always does.\n<br />I rewrote it. \n<br />So far, so good.\n<br />\n<br />A smaller issue: if you leave the camp and the cell unloads, then get back while the Forsworn are dead or not-yet-respawned, two new soldiers pop up and stand there like idiots.\n<br />This has been taken care of, too.\n<br />\n<br />To put things back on the rails [color=#f1c232]you should install this while away from the Reach[/color].\n<br />Then approach the camp (when you happen to be there, no hurry) so that you see the soldiers spawn and start fighting.\n<br />[i]\"Join the fray or go on your way,\n<br />the bug has nothing more to say.\"[/i]\n<br />\n<br />After that, you might still have a surplus of soldiers, survivors from previous botched quests.\n<br />If there are any, you can select them in the console and -- after making sure that their ID begins with FF -- enter MarkForDelete.\n<br />Or leave them alone; I suppose they'll die sooner or later -- everyone does.\n<br />\n<br />Lastly, I was indeed tempted to delete the whole darned, silly thing and be done with it :)"
