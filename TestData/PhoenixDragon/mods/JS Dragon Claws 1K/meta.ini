I decided to make them look more like actual Dragon Claws, with two variants; metal and gemstone. This mod was made a while back, just unreleased because I wasn't sure about it at the time.\n<br />\n<br />I didn't make any edits to the Animal sigils displayed on each claw, so that aspect is kept vanilla (including textures). I recommend installing this over the top of other mods that edit Ruins Clutter.\n<br />\n<br />Appearance may vary based on ENB / non-ENB settings.\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/qzCZH0C.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ffff00]What this mod includes:[/color][/b]\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]New Models and Textures for Vanilla Dragon Claws.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[center][b][color=#ff0000]Do NOT optimize the textures! Some maps are purposely uncompressed![/color][/b][/center]\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/qzCZH0C.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Use Nexus Mod Manager\n<br />\n<br />or\n<br />\n<br />Extract the downloaded archive into your Skyrim SE Data Folder.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff]Note:[/color][/b] As this is a loose archive, when asked to overwrite any existing files, [b][u]ALWAYS[/u][/b] select \"yes\".\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/qzCZH0C.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Questions:\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Q. Will this conflict with other mods that change the appearance of Dragon Claws?\n<br />A. Yes, so please make sure that you overwrite any files when prompted.\n<br />\n<br />Q. I installed \"X\" mod and now the textures are messed up on the claws. How can I fix it?\n<br />A. Reinstall JS Dragon Claws and make sure to overwrite any files.\n<br />\n<br />Q. Will you do any of the other Claws in-game?\n<br />A. Unfortunately no. I have to work on other projects.\n<br />\n<br />Q. Why didn't you re-texture the animal sigils on the claws?\n<br />A. As they are very small, I felt it was unnecessary and other mods have done to a quality standard.\n<br />\n<br />Q. What mods are you working on/got planned?\n<br />A. Those are posted on my\xa0[url=http://www.facebook.com/johnskyrim][b]facebook[/b][/url]\xa0page!\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/qzCZH0C.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />If for some reason the files do not work, cause crashes\n<br />or any other problems, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n<br />\n<br />All screenshots are taken directly from the game and resized down from 1920x1080 to 1280x720. No other editing has been done.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks and I hope you enjoy this Skyrim Mod!\xa0[b]Remember, modding is stressful and we do it for free![/b]\n<br />\n<br />PS.
