nexusDescription="[code]\xfeff[/code]High Poly Project is an amazing mod, but there's a tiny issue when using it alongside popular texture overhauls like Majestic Mountains. Textures for the new rock fences added by High Poly Project look out of place compared to some modded textures. This is a collection of loose files that change the rock fence texture to match your mountain textures.\n<br />\n<br />Download and install the file that matches your rock textures. You could also use one that doesn't match your rock textures if you wish. Try all of them out and choose your favorite if you want! [b]Choose only one.[/b] These mods are 100% safe to swap out mid playthrough since they're just textures.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Place this mod anywhere below High Poly Project in Mod Manger so that it overwrites High Poly Project.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Currently supports:\n<br />[i]Majestic Mountains - Cathedral Concept (lightside, darkside and main)\n<br />Vivid Landscapes\n<br />Northfire's Photoreal Mountains 2 (main and vanilla)[/i]\n<br />\n<br />The following spoiler contains instructions on how to make this extremely simple patch yourself. You can use this to make a patch for any texture mod you want, and it's really easy.\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Mod Organizer 2 users only:[/b]\n<br />1. Find the texture mod that does mountain textures in your mod-list, right-click it and select \"Open in explorer\"\n<br />2. Navigate to textures -&gt; Landscape -&gt; mountains\n<br />3. Inside the mountains folder, copy \"mountainslab01.dds\" and \"mountainslab01_n.dds\"\n<br />4. Go back to your mod-list in MO2 and create an empty mod. Call it \"HPP rockfence patch\" or something.\n<br />5. Right-click the empty mod you just made and select\xa0\"Open in explorer\"\n<br />6. Inside, create a folder named \"textures\"\n<br />7. Inside \"textures\", create a folder named \"high poly project\"\n<br />8. Inside \"high poly project\", paste\xa0mountainslab01.dds and mountainslab01_n.dds from your mountain texture mod\n<br />9. rename\xa0mountainslab01.dds to \"stonewall.dds\" and rename\xa0mountainslab01_n.dds to \"stonewall_n.dds\"\n<br />10. Go back to your mod-list and make sure the patch is anywhere below High Poly Project. Activate it\n<br />11. Test in-game. If you don't like the way it looks, in step 3\xa0you could copy\xa0mountainslab02.dds and mountainslab02_n.dds instead and see if that's better \n<br />(note: any texture seams and stretching\xa0you notice was there before this fix. I don't know what to do about that, sorry)\n<br />\n<br />\xfeff[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />All credit goes to the original authors of the mods supported in this patch.\n<br />\n<br />Thank you!"
