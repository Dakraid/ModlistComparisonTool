nexusDescription="This is a simple esp light flaged patch that adds a condition to the sunlight damage for Simon Magus and rodvt's Scion - A Vampire Overhaul. If you wear a hood or a helmet you will not take sun damage anymore, and you will run in Tamriel under the light of sun (I'm not talking about SunJeong, I mean... I'm talking about the sun itself).\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639]Scion[/url]\xfeff (because this patch uses its stats and it has its name in the title lol) and became a Vampire Lord.\n<br />[*]If you are already a vampire with Scion installed, go to an interior building and save your game there.\n<br />[*]Install this patch.\n<br />[*]Load your game, wear a hood or helmet and go outside to laugh at the face of those guards that fear the night \"[i]because werewolves and vampires don't[/i]\".\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/xSSkarv.png[/img]\xfeff\xfeff[/center]\n<br />Known issues:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][s]Any armor piece that has the vanilla \"ArmorHelmet\" or \"ClothingHead\" keywords will give you this vampiric sunscreen.[/s]\n<br />[/list]Update: I've create patches for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3479]Immersive Armors[/url]\xfeff, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2140]JS Circlets[/url]\xfeff, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8923]Crown Helmets[/url]\xfeff and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9651]TERA Armors[/url]\xfeff that removes these keywords and replaces them for ClothingCirclet.\n<br />\n<br />If you want to still having the Heavy/Light Armor Perk bonusses, you can try the following mods:\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191]Adamant[/url]\xfeff: Lore-friendly perk overhaul, it has excelent armor perks, and it has new perks and tweaks for the original perks that will fit your favorite classes for roleplay (yes, no more sneaky archer at the end).\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23070/]Heavy and Light Armor Perks Tweak[/url]\xfeff: Simple tweak for armor perks, now you just need 3 pieces of armor to gain bonusses, and it has 3 versions to choose.\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37633]Mix and Match Armour Perk Overhaul[/url]\xfeff: New armor perk bonusses, now you can mix light and heavy armor to gain their bousses.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][b][u]You can run naked across Tamriel wearing just a hood, a helmet [s]or a circlet[/s] and you'll not take sun damage[/u][/b]\xa0(please, don't try it or I'll hunt you down in the name of Molag Bal). Most circlets in vanilla Skyrim will not protect you from the sun, but be aware that you'll still needing hoods to protect you from the sun.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Next to do: an armor count version. I'll make another version of the patch that needs a keyword count of 4 armor or pieces, but I'm not if it will work because you'll not be able to be protected with mix armors of clothing with armor gauntlets and boots.\xa0I'll try to add something more realistic and immersive, this is just a quick patch that I want to develop it better, and make patches for other vampire overhauls (maybe). Don't endorse this thing, endorse the original mod and give to Simon and rodvt some kudos."
