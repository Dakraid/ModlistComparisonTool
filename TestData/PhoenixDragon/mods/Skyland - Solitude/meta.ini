Place below other mods that retexture Solitude or the Blue Palace.Place above mods that replace the main gate mesh if you wish to keep those or enjoy the new front gate textures included. Place below SMIM.\xa0\n<br />Manually install play unzipping and dragging the contents of the data folder into the game's data folder.\n<br />\n<br />Compatibility:\n<br />Everything except any texture mod that retextures Solitude. If you find any mods such as ELFX or SMIM, place this mod below them.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Bugs:\n<br />None. If you find a game breaking bug, place your bug in the bug section, not the comments.\n<br />\n<br />Details:\n<br />2k/2k textures with a few less than that such as nail heads and roofs. They don't need to be 2k.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Note from the MA:\n<br />Thanks for making it to the bottom of the description page. You represent the 1%. Anyway, this mod has been a labor of love and burned me out about 3 times. I started around last November and most of these textures were remade multiple times because I just couldn't find a style I liked or what I was producing was sub-par. I'm very proud of this mod, and if you know my library of Skyland mods at all, I think this is my best one. A lot of the textures were made by hand in photoshop, one line at a time. If you've caught any of my live streams, you'd see the hours poured into this. A lot of the other textures were created using 3d scans of stones, grass, moss, slate, and stucco work then compiled in substance or megascans. Here's a cool image of the tombstones in development:\xa0\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/zW9Jse8.jpg[/img]\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />Anyway, I want to thank each and every person here who's downloaded a Skyland mod, dropped me a comment or PM and to all those who've bought me a cup of coffee or a subscription to Nexus. Skyland wouldn't be nearly as big as it's become without you and I would have stopped after landscapes (and originally wasn't going to be uploaded, but I was prodded into it), but I really made all of these for you peoples. Thanks for all the support. We are the little mod library that could.\xa0[/left]"
