It was directly inspired by the\xa0[b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/93362?tab=user+files]Rudy HQ - More Lights for ENB SE[/url]\xfeff[/b]\xa0series of mods, and I would not have been able to release it without Rudy102's help. Thanks, man!\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/rtqYMti.gif[/img][/center]\n<br />[b][color=#e06666][size=4][u]Installation:\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/size][/color][/b]To use version 3.0 of this mod, you must first install ENB 0.365 binaries or newer. Then, make sure you've also installed [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6343/]Barenziah's Glory SE[/url], which is a firm and\xa0 mandatory requirement of this mod, because that great mod includes Gamwich's corresponding normal map image for the diffuse box textures included here. Finally, download and install this mod using MO2 (or the utility of your choosing) and select the color and resolution you prefer.\n<br />\n<br />You must have \"EnableComplexParticleLights\" enabled in the Effects section and \"EnableBigRange\"in the [COMPLEXPARTICLELIGHTS] section of your ENB ini.\n<br />\n<br />Simple as that! Never miss a glowing bauble again!\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/39252/39252-1597613925-810691468.jpeg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\xfeff[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/39252/39252-1597613959-1208173673.jpeg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />This is a port of my LE mod. The meshes and textures have been processed using both the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23316]Cathedral Assets Optimizer[/url]\xa0\x61nd [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4089]SSE NIF Optimizer[/url].\n<br />\n<br />The original mod is located [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67239]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#e06666][size=4][u]Original concept:[/u][/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />I have used\xa0[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4522213/?]Saerileth's[/url] excellent\xa0[b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6343/]Barenziah's Glory[/url][/b] mod for a while now, because it's easily the best mod for improving the visuals of the Crown and Stones of Barenziah on the Nexus. However, as much as I love the awesome glimmering quality\xa0that\xa0[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4522213/?]Saerileth's[/url] mods are known for (and[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6343/]\xa0[/url][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6343/]Barenziah's Glory[/url][/b]\xa0is no exception),\xa0I recently found myself missing the glow that used to accompany the Stones of Barenziah. \n<br />\n<br />What can I say?\n<br />\n<br />I like my floating baubles to glow, apparently.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#e06666][size=4][u]Details:[/u][/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />In a nutshell: I took the meshes into Nifskope, re-UV'ed the gems to twice their previous scale, messed with some properties, flipped some things around, then loaded up Photoshop, made some new 1k Stone textures and -\xa0[i]voil\xe0!\xa0- [/i]glowing Stones of Barenziah that still seem to glitter in the light as well.\n<br />\n<br />Mind you, in doing this, I've somewhat undone quite a bit of what\xa0Saerileth has done to make the gems look so realistic, but I was pleasantly surprised by the results and thought that it might be something that could appeal to people who also like a little glow with their shiny.\n<br />\n<br />Finally, thanks to\xa0[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4522213/?]Saerileth's[/url] gracious nature, I am able to share them with you.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#e06666][size=4]Notes:\n<br />[/size][/color][/u][/b][b][u][color=#e06666][size=4]\n<br />[/size][/color][/u][/b]I still have not been able to test for the appearance of my newly-colorful glowing Stones of Barenziah under the influence of various ENBs. If you are running any of the more popular ENB flavors, I'd still love to see how these look with your config, so please don't hesitate to share an image or two (along with info on what ENB the image was taken with in the title).\n<br />\n<br />As ever, thanks!"
