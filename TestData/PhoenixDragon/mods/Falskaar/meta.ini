They are denoted &#39;The Traveler&#39;, based on an old prophecy.[/size][/center][size=3]\r<br />\r<br />[/size][center][size=3]&#34;They who arrive through the shimmering wall mark the start of the worst.&#34;[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][i][color=#ffff00][size=6]F.A.Q.[/size][/color][size=6] at the bottom of the page.[/size]\r<br />[size=5]Please READ IT before using the mod&#33;[/size][/i][/center]\r<br /> \r<br />[center][color=#00ff00][size=6][u]What is Falskaar?[/u][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Falskaar is a new lands mod that adds an entirely new worldspace to the world. It&#39;s accessed by a dungeon the first time, then by boat from then on out. Falskaar&#39;s goal was to sharpen my skills in almost all areas around the board, with a focus in level and dungeon design. The result is that there is at least a little bit of everything. There is a new land, places, people, quests, dungeons and more for the player to experience. It adds roughly 20+ hours of content, and favors all types of characters.\r<br />\r<br />[center]This is [b]NOT[/b] a beta. This is [b]NOT[/b] a test version. This is a [u]100% completed[/u] new lands mod.[/center] [center](New and/or updated content may still be added, but the main production is complete)[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]Features[/b][/size]\r<br />[list][*]An entirely new land independent of Tamriel, roughly the size of 2-3 Skyrim holds.\r<br />[/*][*]20-30+ hours of gameplay.\r<br />[/*][*]26 quests, including a 9 quest long main story, and 17 side quests&#33; (Along with some unmarked content)\r<br />[/*][*]New items including new books, recipes, weapons and armors. (A mix of brand new, and retextured)*\r<br />[/*][*]Two new spells and a new shout.*\r<br />[/*][*]A bard with several unique new songs.\r<br />[/*][*]A soundtrack containing 14 brand new tracks composed by Adamm Khuevrr just for Falskaar, adding more than 40 minutes of new music&#33;\r<br />[/*][*]A fully voiced experience, featuring almost 30 semi-professional and professional voice actors and actresses.\r<br />[/*][/list]\r<br />* Weapons, armor and spells were not the focus of this mod. As such, do not expect grand things in these areas, they are simple little touches to make everything a bit less vanilla.\r<br />\r<br />Not all quests in this mod blatantly hold your hand. If you seem to be stuck, look around and think through the quest. All quests were rigorously tested for complete-ability, so it&#39;s more likely than not that you just have to figure it out without a blatant quest marker telling you what to do.\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=5][u][color=#00ff00]What does Falskaar [/color][color=#ff0000]require?[/color][/u][/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />- Falskaar [color=#ff0000]only requires[/color] the latest version of Skyrim SE.\r<br />- It [color=#ff0000]does NOT[/color] require any DLC.\r<br />- It [color=#ff0000]does NOT[/color] require any additional utility mods like SKSE.\r<br /> \r<br />[center][color=#00ff00][size=5][u]Installing/Updating Falskaar[/u][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*To install Falskaar simply extract all items in the archive into your Skyrim/Data folder. The archive should contain 4 items, &#34;Falskaar.esm&#34;, &#34;Falskaar.bsa&#34;, &#34;Video/Falskaar_Intro.bik&#34;, and &#34;Video/Falskaar_Outro.bik&#34;. Place Falskaar.esm in your load order above all ESP files, as close to the DLC as possible. (So close to the top) Exact order may not matter, as Falskaar shouldn&#39;t conflict with many things, but it should be near the top as other mods may later edit Falskaar.\r<br />\r<br />*You may also install with a mod manager, like NMM. This will work just fine, manual installation is not required.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />To update Falskaar simply extract the new files and replace/overwrite the old ones.\r<br />\r<br />Note: Updating Falskaar in the middle of playing it shouldn&#39;t have any crazy repercussions, but not all bug fixes/changes may take effect. The only way to surely get a clean 100% update is to start with a clean save.\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#00ff00][size=5][u]How to Start Falskaar/What level should you be?[/u][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[b]IMPORTANT&#33;:[/b] When you first load up your game with the mod active, WAIT for a few hours (in Skyrim time) to let Falskaar&#39;s content and characters settle down. This will help avoid issues if you manage to reach the content &#39;too quickly&#39;. (Like blasting through the first dungeon. Do it fast enough, and the first cut scene gets wonky)\r<br />\r<br />To start Falskaar, go to Riften and speak with Jalamar. He will either be outside around the market, inside the northern gate, or inside the Bee and Barb. You can also just go straight into Echo Deep Mine, a new dungeon just northeast of Riften.\r<br /> \r<br />The mod does not have a level requirement. It scaled in a similar manner to Skyrim, ideally providing a balanced experience for players regardless of their level. However, like Skyrim, if you&#39;re level 80 you may find bandits to be rather trivial. Mods that alter scaling and banditry/enemies in Skyrim will not affect Falskaar bandits as they are a unique setup. See compatibility (below) for more information.\r<br /> \r<br />IMPORTANT: Do NOT use the console during this to set stages, open doors or disabled objects&#33; Falskaar has been rigorously tested and nothing should be broken, so by doing this you void any hope for support, and will most likely break stuff.\r<br /> \r<br />[center][color=#00ff00][size=5][u]Mod Compatibility Info[/u][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[b]FOLLOWERS[/b]: This mod is fully navmeshed, and should work just fine with most/all followers.\r<br />\r<br />Falskaar was designed with compatibility in mind. That said, there are still a few minor areas that will cause conflict:\r<br />1) The area just outside of Riften along the path to the NE where the entrance to Echo Deep Mine is added.\r<br />2) The portion of Dawnstar Bay that Wulf&#39;s ship now occupies.\r<br />\r<br />Mods that conflict with these areas may cause you problems. Otherwise, there are no major compatibility concerns. Falskaar was designed with compatibility in mind, so many mods will work automatically, like wildlife replaces, etc. However, some mods will NOT and will require compatibility patches. This includes mods that alter the bandits of Skyrim, Necromancers, Guards, or music. (List not all-inclusive, of course, there are plenty of other areas as well)\r<br /> \r<br />Do NOT clean Falskaar.esm. It has been thoroughly cleaned before release and contains NO dirty edits. All edits to vanilla records are intentional and necessary.\r<br /> \r<br />[center][color=#00ff00][size=5][u]Uninstalling Falskaar[/u][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]The\xa0uninstallation\xa0of Falskaar mid-game is [color=#ff0000]NOT[/color] supported.[/size] It&#39;s simply too big. Treat Falskaar like a DLC, and do NOT remove it during a playthrough. Only remove if you are starting a new game. To remove (Only for new game) simply delete &#34;Video/Falskaar_Intro.bik&#34;, &#34;Video/Falskaar_Outro.bik&#34;, &#34;Falskaar.bsa&#34;, and &#34;Falskaar.esm&#34;. Failure to follow the above conditions will likely result in serious, irreversible damage to your save and is not recommended or supported.\r<br />\r<br />The good news about this is that Falskaar alters very little of vanilla content. If you ignore the new dungeon entrance, boat in the Dawnstar bay, and never go to Falskaar it will have NO effect on your gameplay in Skyrim. It will simply take a spot in your load order from that point onward. However it is, of course, my hope that you will not desire to remove Falskaar ever. Hopefully it will provide you with plenty of enjoyable content, even once you leave Falskaar, in the form of weapons, armors, recipes, etc.\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#00ff00][size=5][u]Permissions and Credits[/u][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Permissions and Credits are available above (Perms & Credits button at top of mod page), as well as in the ReadMe.\r<br />\r<br />Reviewers, spot-lighters, and critics are free to use and record footage of the mod, and may use content posted on the Nexus site in their videos - So long as intent and proper crediting is made clear.\r<br />\r<br />Credits are available in video form on Youtube, here: http://youtu.be/h60oDEkKO9g\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#00ff00][size=5][u]Patch Notes[/u][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />For detailed patch notes, see the Changelog (Changelog button near top of mod page) for the current, and previous versions. They are also available in the ReadMe.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#00ff00][size=5][u]Translations[/u][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Translations are now OPEN.[/size] It has grown out of my capacity to manage them. You are free the translate the mod as you wish, without my permission and upload the translation where you see fit. The only requirement to translate now, is that you follow these rules:\r<br />\r<br />1. It must be clear that I am the author of the mod, and you are the translator.\r<br />2. It must be clear that I do not support the translated version in any way. I cannot ensure that it has not been modified beyond translating, or that it is up to date.\r<br />3. You may not alter the mod beyond translating it.\r<br />4. I cannot help you translate. You are free to do so, but you are on your own if you choose to do so.\r<br />\r<br />Best wishes to everyone, and thank you for helping the mod reach a broader international community&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#ffff00][size=6][u]F.A.Q.[/u][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q: I get a &#39;system out of memory&#39; issue when trying to install with NMM, how do I fix this?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />A; This is a problem with large mods and NMM on 32-bit machines. To get around this error, simply manually install the mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q: I&#39;m stuck at some part in the main quest, what should I do?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />A: Many problems being reported are just issues with the unpredictability of the game. Waiting in-game for several hours (1-6 is usually good) fixes a lot of these issues by letting the other actors in the game catch up. I&#39;ll work to improve this, but there&#39;s only so much I can do. (Once other mods get involved and a lot is happening it rapidly gets impossible to control)\r<br />\r<br />[b]\r<br />Q: The end of Fort Urokk doesn&#39;t work for me, when will you be fixing that?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />A: This is not a bug with the mod, but a mod conflict. Mods that [u]allow children to be killable[/u] were not accounted for during development, and [u]their use (Thus causing Wilhard to die) is not recommended[/u], and will cause issues. I believe this mod to be the cause of this issue, so try disabling it for the duration of this quest. Reports so far say that allows them to complete the quest without issue.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q: [Mild MQ Spoiler] I can&#39;t find the key in Bearclaw cave during Strength & Wisdom, where is it?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />A: Search the final room of the cave, it&#39;s in there. It is not in a container, so &#39;explosive&#39; spells may fling it around making it harder to find. This is being improved in 1.2.0.0.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q: A quest isn&#39;t advancing and/or things seem to have pointlessly broken&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />A: While a legitimate bug is certainly possible, an overwhelming amount of issues with scripts failing to fire in Falskaar are caused by Papyrus being overloaded by other mods. Please enable Papyrus logging via the instructions below, then observe your logs as you play. ~30 minutes of play shouldn&#39;t result in a very big log (depending on your mods). If it makes, say, a 10mb log, that&#39;s huge&#33; Please search the log for repeating or intrusive errors. Please also search for any errors containing &#34;FSKR&#34; or &#34;Falskaar&#34;. Report the latter to me, and the respective mod owners for any others.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Enable papyrus logging:[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Open Skyrim.ini (My Documents/My Games/Skyrim) and add the following to it if it isn&#39;t already there:\r<br />\r<br />[Papyrus]\r<br />fPostLoadUpdateTimeMS=500.0\r<br />bEnableLogging=1\r<br />bEnableTrace=1\r<br />bLoadDebugInformation=1\r<br />\r<br />Afterward adding those lines and playing some, you&#39;ll get new folders in &#34;My Games/Skyrim&#34; called &#34;Logs/Script&#34;. In Script you will find 1 to 4 Papyrus logs. (0, 1, 2 and 3, 0 being the most recent) You may open them with any text editor (like Notepad)."
