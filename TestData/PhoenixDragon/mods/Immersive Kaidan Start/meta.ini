nexusDescription="Kaidan 2 is a popular follower mod, but it always bugged me that you are given a quest to find him from the start of the game. This patch removes the objective to find him on the start of the game, and instead adds a few ways to find him in game in a more immersive way. \n<br />\n<br />This mod does the following:\n<br />[spoiler]1) You can ask Orgnar in Riverwood about anything interesting happening in town which prompts you to investigate Kaidan's Old Camp.\n<br />2) If you search his camp, you will find evidence of a Thalmor battle there, and orders to capture Kaidan which leads you to his location.\n<br />3) After you are level 20, you can randomly find the same orders on random Thalmor.[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Installation\n<br />Install after Kaidan 2 and let this mod overwrite it.\n<br />\n<br />Compatibility\n<br />Should be compatible with anything, unless it edits quest K01 from Kaidan 2, or edits Kaidan's Old Camp."
