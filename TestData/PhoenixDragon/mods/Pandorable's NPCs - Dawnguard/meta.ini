My goal was to give each of them fresh new looks while staying somewhat true to their original appearance and personality.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is fully standalone and overhauls a total of 27 NPCs, both male and female. Just like with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19012]Pandorable's NPCs[/url], I have kept it lightweight by having the NPCs use the skin and body mods you have installed. I've also left the NPC weights untouched for increased compatiblity with other mods. The skin textures you have installed will drastically change the looks of any NPC, so they might not look the same in your game as in my screenshots. I used bijin skin for females, and SoS and dizona for males.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/94863]LEGENDARY EDITION[/url][/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cccccc][size=5]COMPATIBILITY[/size][/color]\n<br />This mod is technically incompatible with any mod that edits the same NPCs, but most NPC overhauls can be used together without issues. Just like with my previous replacer mod, I have avoided any NPCs covered by the Bijin series so that they could be used together without issues. \n<br />I haven't tried myself yet, but this mod should be perfectly fine to merge if you want to save a plugin slot.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cccccc][size=5]INSTALLATION &amp; REQUIREMENTS[/size][/color]\n<br />Install using a mod manager of your choice or manually extract the contents to your Data folder.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cccccc][size=5]FAQ[/size][/color]\n<br />[b]Q: Help, the faces are messed up![/b]\n<br />A: Rearrange your load order, put this mod near the bottom, or reinstall. Also make sure you have downloaded the correct version. Take a look at your load order to see if any of your other mods might be incompatible with this one. Feel free to ask for help in the comments, but please save us both some time and do some troubleshooting on your own first!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: Can you add/change/remove this?[/b]\n<br />A: Not unless there is an actual problem with my mod. This is my vision and I'm happy with it. I will[i] absolutely not [/i]make any special versions for strangers on the internet.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: Why didn't you do [i]this [/i]NPC?[/b]\n<br />A: Short answer; I didn't feel like it. Long answer; I usually have a clear image in my head of how I think each character should look, often based on their personality, original appearance or an idea. However, there were some characters that I simply didn't have a vision for, and I'd rather not force it and make something that doesn't feel quite right.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: What about Serana and Valerica?[/b]\n<br />A: I have now released them separately.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: Can I request an NPC?[/b]\n<br />A: Not this time. There aren't any more vampire/Dawnguard related NPCs that I want to make at this time, but perhaps the remaining NPCs will show up in a future mod.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cccccc][size=5]NPCS ALTERED[/size][/color]\n<br />Full NPC list with names and IDs [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MsDSJvAvxPvg-SSRMrr-MB0Gswy9FwsMzpfB8uDxf6s/edit?usp=sharing]here[/url].\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cccccc][size=5]CREDITS[/size][/color]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?]RaceMenu\xa0[/url]\xfeff\x62y expired\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?]KS Hairdos Renewal[/url]\xa0\x62y kalilies, stealthic khaos &amp; shocky\n<br />[url=http://kalilies.tumblr.com/]Kalilies Hair[/url] by kalilies\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34539]Battle Hardened Warpaints[/url] by diethardt\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/94629]Female Makeup Suite[/url] by domainwolf\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95587]Community Overlays[/url] by domainwolf\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49279]Northborn Scars[/url] by northborn\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72825]Maevan2's Eye Brows[/url] by maevan2\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30411/?]Brows\xa0[/url]by hvergelmir\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28363]Beards[/url] by hvergelmir\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722]Eyes of Beauty[/url] by lograam\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/82588]Improved Eyes Skyrim[/url] by missjennabee &amp; nazenn\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3589]Natural Eyes[/url] by nevenbridge\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56056]Mikan Eyes[/url] by nerune\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/91953]Bijin Skin[/url] by rxkx22\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/82948]Vitruvia[/url] by mandragorasprouts\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32986/?]Mature Skin[/url] by maevan2\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/86208]FreckleMania 2[/url] by tetrodoxin\n<br />\n<br />Please support these amazing modders by downloading and endorsing their work!\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cccccc][size=5]SPECIAL THANKS[/size][/color]\n<br />This mod would still be a work in progress if it wasn't for my good friend [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/25051294]chickmetalhead[/url] - who has helped in too many ways to count, from troubleshooting and giving advice to meticulous testing and lending a hand with the techy stuff I suck at!
