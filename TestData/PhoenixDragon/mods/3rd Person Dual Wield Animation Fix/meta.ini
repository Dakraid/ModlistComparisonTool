nexusDescription="This is a simple mod to allow dual weapon wielders to hold their weapon at their side, rather than holding the primary weapon up in the air. \r<br />\r<br />Converted from imeltfaces&#39; mod for the original Skyrim game with Bethesda&#39;s HAVOK 32-bit to 64-bit conversion tool. See the original mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/248/?]here.\r<br />\r<br />[/url]In Oldrim, I long considered this mod essential for any dual wielding character. The default dual wielding poses and moves created by Bethesda seemed jarring and unnatural to me.\xa0 When I resumed playing my dual wield character in Skyrim SE,\xa0 I was disappointed to not see it on Nexus SSE. So with the original mod author&#39;s permission I converted his animation files into a format that the new game could use."
