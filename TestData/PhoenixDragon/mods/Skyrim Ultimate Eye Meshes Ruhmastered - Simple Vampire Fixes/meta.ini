Because the NPCs edited by rxkx22 were created using a variety of eye meshes, the facegen mesh patches were required to make sure all edited NPCs now contain all fixes/upgrades uniformly.\xa0 With these patches, every edited NPC in the Bijin series has immunity to the eye invisibility glitch without script, has RANs extended reflection, blue specular color removed, and double sided eye meshes.\xa0 Functionality + Added Realism)\n<br />Please visit [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11]Bijin AIO 2019[/url], as these eyemeshes and more have been incorporated there!\n<br />\n<br />v1.1 Update -
