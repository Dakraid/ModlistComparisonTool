nexusDescription="[center][size=5]Super Fast Get Up Animation[/size]\n<br />by Everglaid\n<br />\n<br />Special Edition | [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/106906]Legendary Edition[/url]\xfeff\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />Handmade standing up animations for when an actor is knocked off their feet. \n<br />Face down is 1.25 seconds long and face up is 1.5 - opposed to vanilla's 3 seconds (face down) and 5.6 seconds. (face up)\n<br />Is it realistic? I don't know. But being stabbed 30 times while getting up doesn't feel so great.\n<br />Default is a replacer, player-only and/or in combat options are available if using Dynamic Animation Replacer.\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]qCWTwUeKCJ0[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requires:[/b]\n<br />Nothing.\n<br />Optionally, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33746]Dynamic Animation Replacer[/url]\xfeff\xfeff and their [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444]requirements[/url]\xfeff\xfeff if using it conditionally.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\n<br />Please use a mod manager. This includes a FOMOD package for selecting options.\n<br />Safe to uninstall mid-playthrough, no plugins or scripts.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Compatibility:[/b]\n<br />Should be compatible with almost everything.\n<br />Allow this file to overwrite other standing up animations, like [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17196]Ultimate Combat[/url]\xfeff\xfeff or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5890]D13 Faster GET UP STAND UP ANIMATION[/url]\xfeff\xfeff \n<br />They will replace one another, [i]unless you select the DAR version in the installer. [/i]\n<br />For example, you can use the above animations for NPCs or when the player is out of combat, and mine otherwise. \n<br />(D13 Faster is the vanilla animation sped up by 2x, so presumably 1.5 &amp; 2.8 seconds respectively)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Notes:[/b]\n<br />the animation seems to get cut off short. not by a full second or anything, more like .05-.1 seconds. it's pretty fast!\n<br />the IK and hand animation systems in-game remove a lot of the detail in the animation.\n<br />things like pressing the palm flat onto the ground and firmly planting your feet down are present, in both the vanilla animation and mine, \n<br />but it's skyrim so expect your knees to buckle and your toes to ballerina your way up anyway[/center]"
