Send them my way!\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff0000][size=3]Installation:[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />- Use NMM and download. Enable and enjoy! Manual installation not recommended unless you know what you're doing.\n<br />- Requires ALL DLC. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000]Detailed Instructions (mod spoilers!):[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]When you're propositioned by Brynjolf, you will have the option to emphatically reject him (\"No. I'm not\xa0interested, and I won't ever be.\"), which will shut down the Thieves' Guild quest line for good. If you do accept his proposition, if you press him (\"I don't really want\xa0to send an innocent man to jail.\"), he'll change his tactics. Highly suggest you upgrade your speech before doing this though, as this DOES require a persuade check! If, after you've gone through with the scam---whether by the vanilla or alternate route---you have one last chance when he wraps up the job (\"No. I'm not doing\xa0that again. Ever.\") to shut down the Thieves' Guild quest line.\n<br />\n<br />Once you're inside the guild, you can pick up the book called \"Honor Among Thieves\" to start the new quest. Just follow the directions! This quest is designed to take you to areas you're already going to visit as part of the Thieves Guild. Once you've reached the point where you have to speak to Delvin, wait until you become Guildmaster, then speak to him again and you can proceed to finish the quest.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />If Taking Care of Business is underway, you will have the option (\"I heard you're in trouble with the Thieves' Guild.\") to cover your targets' debts instead of extorting the money from them. They will consider this a favour and become friendly afterward. This will count toward your Thaneship, as well. (i.e. You can clear three out of the five favours required for Thaneship with this quest alone.)\xa0Or, you may make use of your speach skills to avoid having to blackmail anyone, or break or steal anything. Your targets still won't be happy (and, of course, this won't count as a favour) but at least you didn't have to resort to outright crime!\n<br />\n<br />If Taking Care of Business was resolved through extortion with any of the targets instead of the friendly option, once you complete Under New Management, you---in your new capacity as guildmaster---will be able to speak on behalf of the Thieves' Guild (\"No apologies, but the\xa0Thieves' Guild is looking to rebuild some burnt bridges.\") and rebuild your relationship with them. This will not alter their disposition toward your the player, but neither did the original Taking Care of Business quest, so they should remain as acquaintances or friends, depending on if you've done a separate favour quest for them. What it will do, is remove their antagonistic greetings.\n<br />\n<br />Moving on, when Brynjolf briefs you for Loud and Clear, you have the chance (\"The Black-Briars, right? Why not try to keep the entire harvest?\") to convince him to let you spare the apiaries. And at Goldenglow itself, you have the option (\"You just trust the Guild. Do right by us, and we'll do right by you.\") to persuade Aringoth not to play nice. If you didn't burn any of his hives, he'll take it as a sign of good faith and you'll automatically pass the speech check. And if you manage to pass the speech check, his mercenaries will no longer attack you on sight. Be careful, however; if you go back on your word and burn any hives down afterward, they'll turn on you like the traitor you are.\n<br />\n<br />And, finally, as you go through Dampened Spirits, you get to show some actual defiance (\"As long as we're\xa0\x63lear I'm here for the Guild, not for you.\") to Maven. On\xa0the grounds at Honningbrew, you'll have to do your job, but you have the chance (\"If you'll take my\xa0\x61\x64vice, I suggest you cancel the tasting.\")\xa0to save Sabjorn from jail. There is also extended dialogue for you to rat Mallus out or cut him loose (\"You mentioned someone named Mallus?\") Ratting him out to Sabjorn will have him arrested, while cutting him loose\xa0will send him fleeing to Black-Briar Meadery in Riften. When you get back to Sabjorn, you'll have multiple options available to get his dresser key off him---Mallus isn't likely to be cooperative when he finds out you've double-crossed him, after all. If your Speech isn't high enough, returning Sabjorn your pay for exterminating the vermin will always do the job.\xa0Rub your defiance in Mallus' (\"I did my part. The\xa0mead's poisoned. It's not my fault Sabjorn found out.\")\xa0\x61nd Maven's (\"Looks like Sabjorn cancelled the tasting. Whoops.\")\xa0\x66\x61\x63\x65s, then let Brynjolf know (\"Someone has to remind her we're the Thieves' Guild, not her lapdogs.\") you mean business.\n<br />\n<br />Also, after you've settled in with the Thieves' Guild---heard Vex, Delvin, and Tonilia's introductions---Vex and Delvin will offer dialogue (\"Let's focus on a single city. Speed things along there.\")\xa0to focus the radiant jobs in a given city. You are able to toggle the visibility of this dialogue in the MCM. In the MCM, you can also toggle the ability to take all seven radiant jobs at once, as well as adjust the radiant job requirements for the trophies to appear on behind the Thieves' Guild guildmaster's desk in the Ragged Flagon's cistern. In addition, you can reset Mjoll's disposition toward you to discuss the Thieves' Guild with her again, allowing you to tell her about your plans to join the Thieves' Guild and change it from within. And, as a little extra, you can finish Tonilia's introduction without mouthing off to her.\n<br />\n<br />*There's nothing stopping you from doing so, but please avoid disabling the ability to take all seven radiant jobs concurrently while you're still on the jobs, as the required dialogue to complete them may not show correctly. Re-enabling the option should allow the dialogue to display correctly again.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]"
