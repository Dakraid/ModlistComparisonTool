nexusDescription="Hello and welcome to my latest project I've been working on, Winterhold Deep Sea Ruins.\xa0 Expanding on the lore of The Great Collapse, This mod adds lots of underwater ruins to explore and loot, a new dungeon in an air pocket underneath the ruins, and new + existing lore to tie it all together.\xa0 I hope you have fun taking a look at it\n<br />\n<br />The submerged ruins are designed to go with JK's Skyrim (or JK's Winterhold), or any equivalent mod that expands on the ruins of winterhold, and should match that same style. although it is not a requirement for this mod to work.\n<br />\n<br />[b]The dungeon was designed with these 2 mods in mind\xa0[/b]-\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424]ELFX[/url]\xa0(interiors) and my own mod,\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53091]balanced skeletons[/url]. The dungeon is mostly populated with skeletons, so my mod that makes them tougher is vital to giving the dungeon its challenge.\xa0 The difficulty of the dungeon is reliant on those 2 mods for this combination of low visibility and tougher skeleton ambushes.\n<br />I also recommend [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42854]loki's wade in water[/url]\xa0\x66or realism, it works great with the sections of the dungeon that feature knee high water.\n<br />\n<br />I would also recommend doing this solo, companions can get glitched or stuck in areas you'll have to swim through or jump through.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />You can find the starting point of this mods content by going directly northeast from Winterhold,\xa0 a journal found there in the small ruins will point you to the main attraction further away.\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/1704/6695343-1628749044.jpg[/img]\n<br />the shallow ruins marked by the blue arrow\n<br />read journal entry 2 near the statue of talos for directions to the deep ruins\n<br />\n<br />if you looked around and are still really lost, heres the spoiler\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/1704/6695343-1628816822.jpg[/img]\n<br />shallow ruins in blue, deep ruins in red\n<br />[/spoiler]\xfeff\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />tested compatibility -\n<br />fully compatible with JK's WInterhold or JK's Skyrim\n<br />fully compatible with Winterhold Restored\n<br />fully compatible with Great City of Winterhold\n<br />fully compatible with Immersive College of Winterhold\n<br />fully compatbile with arthmoor's telengard\n<br />fully compatible with Winterhold - Expanded Ruins\n<br />\n<br />compatible with depths of skyrim, use the provided patch here and load DOS first, then this mod, then the patch\n<br />patch was made using 1.1.7 of DOS and 1.1 of WDSR\n<br />-\n<br />the mod should also be compatible with any other mods, the areas I worked with are rarely ever used. please bring any compatibility issues to my attention\n<br />\n<br />-\n<br />a version 2.0 of the mod is underway, expanding the dungeon/palace with new interior areas. open to suggestions in comments"
