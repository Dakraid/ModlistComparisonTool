nexusDescription="Reupload of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/17858934]gp160[/url]'s LE mod \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/85083]Turning animation won't affect upperbody[/url]\" and a Nexus port of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/433905]Skypia [/url](Smooth)'s \"[url=https://smooths.tistory.com/4]Disable Turn Animation[/url]\"\n<br />\n<br />[b]*THE UPPERBODY TURNING ANIMATION AFFECTS 1 HANDED WEAPONS ONLY, I'LL HAVE TO MAKE A PATCH FOR 2HANDED*[/b]\n<br />\n<br />These mods basically help with the jittery turning animation in third-person when a weapon is drawn. One completely removes it, the other tries to blend the idle and turning animation.\n<br />\n<br />The Disable Turn Animation mod (Requires SKSE) is designed to be used with animation mods from Skypia or Mo Fu's animation mods as they do not have turn animations. If you install it without those mods your character will just be turning around without their feet moving, which may work with other animation mods.\n<br />\n<br />gp160's mod helps out by [i]\"By restricting turning animations to lowerbody\"[/i]\xa0so that the [i]\"the upperbody discrepancy between ***_idle.hkx and\xa0***_turn***.hkx is removed\".[/i]\xa0Works for most popular animation mods, further instructions are on the original mod page to use this with other animations and weapons.\n<br />\n<br />Please check out the original authors pages and download and endorse their mods if you enjoy them :)"
