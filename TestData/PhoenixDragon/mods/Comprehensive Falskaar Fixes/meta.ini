nexusDescription="[font=Arial][size=4]Introduction\xa0[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />Falskaar is a DLC new land mod created by Alexander J Velicky that adds over 20h of gameplay. This mod has been a favorite for thousands for many years but no longer receives active support. Many have reported some replicable quest breaking bugs which makes it hard to progress in the quest. This mod aims to fix all of those bugs by rebuilding the quests and scripts for better stability.\xa0\n<br />[font=Arial][size=4]\n<br />Features[/size][/font]\n<br />No changes to quest content\n<br />Hopefully every replicable bug reported on Falskaar nexus page fixed\n<br />Each quest edited to improve script debugging and optimization\n<br />All scripts recompiled to remove costly functions such as game.getplayer()\n<br />Lost Knowledge quest correctly starts and bandit reliably spawns for the scene only\n<br />Multiple Fort Urokk quest fixes\n<br />Fast travel does not break quests\n<br />Riding horses does not break quests\n<br />Improved AI packages\n<br />Improved navmesh in certain areas\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][size=4]Requirements[/size][/font]\n<br />[font=Arial][size=4][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2057]Falskaar[/url] by Alexander J Velicky\n<br />\n<br />Compatibility[/size][/font]\n<br />Falskaar - Lost Knowledge Quest Fix: Not compatible but that\x2019s ok because this mod does the same thing.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Falskaar - Patches and Addons: Not compatible with Bug Fixes.esp, this mod must load after it[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[u]Requires a new save[/u]\n<br />\n<br />May or may not be compatible with other patches, I haven\x2019t looked at them all\n<br />[font=Arial][size=4]\n<br />FAQ:[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />Can I install this mid game?\n<br />- If you read this far, you should know that a new game is required.\n<br />\n<br />The bandit in Lost Knowledge isn\x2019t there and I can\x2019t continue the quest!\n<br />- Are you using bug fixes.esp from Falskaar patches and addons? Read the compatibility section.\n<br />\n<br />Something is still broken! You said this is comprehensive!\n<br />- If you are nice and provide information I can act on, I\x2019ll probably try to fix it.\n<br />- There was a lot to address, so it's very possible there are still problems, just let me know.\n<br />\n<br />Too bad I\x2019m not nice!\n<br />- I\x2019ll probably just ignore you then.\n<br />\n<br />Can you patch this/that mod for me?\n<br />- Depends on if you are nice or if I am interested.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />I'm at the place I need to be, and no one is here!\n<br />- Try waiting for up to 24 hours and they will probably show up.\n<br />\n<br />Quest Stages:\n<br />When I get around to it, I will post the quest stages here in case there is still a bug and you need to advance by console."
