Serana will equip it whenever she is outside and wears her armor even if she already has other headgear equipped or it is dark night or she is cured of vampirism. The hood is marked as unplayable so you can't take matters into your own hands either. Which wouldn't work anyway because Serana simply creates a new hood out of thin air and equips it again. This mod offers two solutions, a simple and a realistic one, for this problem.\n<br />\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Serana will never wear the hood and all instances of it will be removed from her inventory.\n<br />[*]Serana will wear the hood if and only if she is outside during the day (5am to 7pm, same as [url=http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Vampirism#Weakness_to_Sunlight]Weakness to Sunlight[/url]), has no other headgear equipped, and is still a vampire.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Load Order\n<br />[/size]\n<br />This mod adds no plugin to your load order. It contains only a modified script from the Dawnguard DLC.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Compatibility[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Incompatible with any mod that edits DLC1_NPCMentalModelScript. Aside from the Unofficial Patch, I'm not aware of any mod that does that.\n<br />\n<br />Fixes from the Unofficial Patch have been included."
