The design of the plugin is to favor a projects stronger elements while providing a cohesive and consistent package, rather just merging all of the sounds together like previous attempts to superseded the one provided. While choices have mostly been curated by myself (and therefore subjective), this patch is still strongly recommended for users of both mods. This is because [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523/]Immersive Sounds[/url] and [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466/]Audio Overhaul for Skyrim[/url][/b] don't entirely overlap, and you'd be missing out on content of one or the other if you chose to not include it in your load order.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=2][img]https://i.imgur.com/ErJM7Qi.gif[/img][/size]\n<br />[i][size=1]\"Look! It's in the clouds!\"[/size][/i][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][b]WHY IS THE PATCH SEPARATED?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The patch has been separated in support for basic mod managers and easy updating of files. If you track AOS on Nexus, you probably don't want to be updated every time the patch is. Does this mean that development will continue beyond this update? No promises.\n<br />\n<br />[b]LOAD ORDER[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[code]Audio Overhaul Skyrim.esp\n<br />Immersive Sounds - Compendium.esp\n<br />AOS_ISC_Integration.esp\n<br />[All Other Mods : Including Weather Mods]\n<br />[Audio Overhaul for Skyrim Patches]\n<br />[Immersive Sounds Compendium Patches][/code]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]FEATURES LIST[/b]\n<br />\n<br />In most cases, ISC and AOS have equal part in each category of sounds. However, a certain mod might take \"priority\" over another in terms of how much influence it has. Weapon sounds, for the most part, are handled by ISC. But AOS also makes edits to dagger weapon records to give them smaller impact sounds (a dagger isn't a longsword). This list is used to give a general idea of what you will be getting out of each mod when looking at these categories.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Audio Overhaul for Skyrim[/b]: [i]Acoustics, Ambience, Bug Fixes, Reverb Parameters, Sound Categorization, Sound Output Models, Traps, Waterfalls[/i]\n<br />[b]Immersive Sounds[/b]: [i]Bug Fixes, Footsteps, Impacts, Item Pickup Sounds, Magic, Weapons[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=2][img]https://i.imgur.com/MFGJlNK.gif[/img][/size]\n<br />[i][size=1]\"Throat of the World\"[/size][/i][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][b]CREDITS[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]David Jegutidse[/b] The incredible designer and creator of Audio Overhaul for Skyrim. David had been one the pioneers of breaking down Skyrim's handling of audio and has created such an incredible set of now iconic and memorable sounds tens of thousands of people still use in their load order until this day. He created one of the most expansive ambient soundscapes ever to be made for the game and helped contribute to many bug fixes and addressing unintentional oversights in this game. Thank you for your contributions, and thank you for allowing me to continue development on this mod to make it as complete as it could be.\n<br />\n<br />[b]lazygecko[/b]  Gecko helped push audio mods for Skyrim into a new category, featuring extensive customization and new techniques in their Immersive Sounds. Their mod helped bring new ideas to the table, featured incredibly clean and professional sound design, and expanded the game rather than what previous mods would do (replace existing sounds). Their work on ISC has served as major inspiration for my own work, and their contributions to the community can't go unnoticed in this post.[/size]"
