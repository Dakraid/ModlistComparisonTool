nexusDescription="[center][b][i][color=#a2c4c9][size=6]\xfeff[font=Georgia]Boats &amp; Ships\n<br />[/font][/size][/color][/i][/b][size=2][i][font=Arial][color=#efefef]{ a simple texture replacer }[/color][/font][/i]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/YRcMqR4l.jpg[/img]\xfeff\xfeff\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />I replaced these textures in my own game over a year ago and realized I never got around to releasing it.\n<br />So here you go, use it or not it's up to you. Tried to keep the textures befitting of Skyrim. Did my best to reduce the green paint on the sides of the ships - I never liked it. It's there a little bit but pretty minimal.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size]There is 1 texture that I couldn't find anywhere in the game and if someone knows where it is that would be great. Texture is\xa0shipwoodside03 I replaced it but couldn't test to see if it looked good or anything so, if someone knows where to find it that would be cool.\n<br />\n<br />If you like it please remember to endorse, thanks.[/center]"
