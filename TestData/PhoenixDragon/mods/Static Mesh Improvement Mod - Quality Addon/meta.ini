nexusDescription="I always loved the SMIM mod, it has many many must have files for every skyrim installation for over 8 years.\n<br />So I decided to add some improvements to it.\n<br />\n<br />- This mod adds environment/cubemaps (better moving reflections) to many SMIM files. Metal parts look way better now.\n<br />The difference is way more noticeable in motion, than in pictures\n<br />\n<br />- So far ~50 objects, I will add another 50 in the next versions\n<br />Performance impact: Less than 1 frame\n<br />\n<br />Next versions:\n<br />- Textures with less compression\n<br />- A few higher Res textures\n<br />- A few more polygons here and there\n<br />\n<br />Maybe I will add some parallax in the future\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659]Orginal awesome SMIM MOD\n<br />[/url]\n<br />\n<br />FAQ: \n<br />a) Separate from my other mods, use this along side Skyrim 2020\n<br />b) load order with my other mods doesn't matter\n<br />1. Which of the different SMIM quality options does this mod contain? \n<br />- Always the highest\n<br />2. dg_cubemap.dds is my redundant cubemap for reflections, like in my other mods. Overwrite or not, doesn't matter.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Installation: Just overwrite SMIM with this or have it later in the load order if you created one[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements:[/b] SMIM - duh\n<br />Got purple stuff? It says Requirements\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Many thanks to Brumbek for creating his wonderful mod and adding so much stuff over the years &lt;3[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Credits: Brumbek, Rudy, thank you guys, you are awesome"
